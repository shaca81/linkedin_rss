Many companies have invested heavily in digital transformation, but despite the projected $6.8 trillion spent by 2023, they often fail to see the expected return on investment. This is due to a lack of understanding of the steps required for a successful transformation.&#13;
&#13;
Buying technology and investing in the latest tech tools is not enough to drive change. It's crucial to have the right processes, culture, and talent in place to fully utilize these tools. The failure to invest in skills development is a significant contributor to the lack of productivity gains from new technologies like AI. Convincing experienced employees and senior managers to embrace new tech tools can also be a challenge for many organizations.&#13;
&#13;
Many companies have fallen into the trap of thinking that technology alone will drive change. But the reality is, without the right processes, culture, and talent in place, even the best technology will fail to deliver results.&#13;

𝘞𝘩𝘺 𝘪𝘴 𝘪𝘵 𝘣𝘦𝘭𝘪𝘦𝘷𝘢𝘣𝘭𝘦?&#13;
Agile businesses, particularly start-ups, seem to turn on a dime and don't appear to have any kind of plan. It's easy to believe that what you see an agile firm doing - acting quickly, maintaining a high tempo, and being highly responsive - is all there is.&#13;
&#13;
𝘞𝘩𝘺 𝘪𝘵’𝘴 𝘸𝘳𝘰𝘯𝘨&#13;
It is not a strategy to be agile. It is a capability, although a very valuable one with immediate operational benefits, but it cannot permanently affect a firm's competitive position unless the right decisions are made about where to direct that capability. And the apparent lack of a plan does not imply that successful start-ups lack strategies. A strategy is not a plan; it is a decision-making framework, a set of guiding principles that can be applied as the situation evolves. Most businesses fail because being able to turn on a dime does not guarantee that you will turn in the right direction. Successful start-ups spend a lot of time debating fundamentals and asking tough questions.&#13;
&#13;
Successful start-ups do a lot of hard thinking about fundamentals, questioning and testing basic assumptions with the rigour that incumbents would do well to imitate. Start-ups must do so because their resources are extremely limited. If they do not have a coherent strategy, they will make poor resource allocation decisions, which will result in death rather than a drop in earnings.&#13;

To drive business resilience, growth, and profits, organizations need to couple radical efficiency with innovation and invest shrewdly in digital.&#13;
&#13;
Smart budget trade-offs, savvy talent strategies, and optimal digital investments will be key to success this year, with organizations focusing on driving margin improvement, generating cash, increasing the productivity of people and assets, and capitalizing on new growth opportunities with fewer resources.&#13;
&#13;
But to succeed, executives must tackle three variables that threaten to weigh down growth and profits in 2023: higher interest rates, lack of available talent, and lagging digital transformation. Higher funding costs reduce ROI and funding is harder to get and justify as investors prioritize investments that generate short-term profitability and cash flow over those that drive future growth. Critical talent, especially those with digital skills, remains expensive and in short supply, despite the slew of layoffs in the tech sector. Boards and CEOs now expect to see top or bottom-line benefits from digital investments, but many CIOs still struggle to demonstrate the business value of IT.&#13;
&#13;
To differentiate performance in 2023, executives need to manage resources and spend strategically, be agile in securing digital talent, and accelerate key digital and technology initiatives. The recession playbook of nine winning actions that Gartner recommended in mid-2022 holds true, with a focus on driving digital transformation success.&#13;

Further, organisations can continuously improve their products while significantly reducing the time to launch products.&#13;
&#13;
⚡Some key benefits of BDA and Digital Twins in manufacturing include the following:&#13;
&#13;
𝟭. 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘀𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: BDA and Digital Twins can enable modelling and optimisation of complex processes.&#13;
𝟮. 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲:  an Integrated Big Data platform created for the continuous prediction of machine&#13;

𝟯. 𝗤𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁: Using BDA, the manufacturer analysed the manufacturing process data to identify the &#13;
critical test parameters.&#13;
𝟰. 𝗥𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗹𝗮𝘂𝗻𝗰𝗵 𝗮 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁 𝗼𝗿 𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲: During product development, organisations can virtually experiment using Digital Twins, reducing the time taken to complete trials.&#13;
𝟱. 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁 𝗶𝗻𝗻𝗼𝘃𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: BDA allows organisations to understand their customer base better by gathering &#13;
and analysing customer feedback, product success, and competitor strategies. As a result, organisations can &#13;
introduce new products while simultaneously updating existing ones.&#13;
𝟲. 𝗦𝗮𝗳𝗲𝘁𝘆 𝗲𝗻𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁: Using Digital Twins, organisations can conduct product testing under conditions that involve high temperatures or pressures in a virtual environment, thereby avoiding mishaps.

&#13;
The technofeudalist model involves establishing a monopoly position and using sophisticated data extraction to secure it. “Having become indispensable,” writes French economist Cédric Durand in his 2020 book Technoféodalisme: Critique de l’Économie Numérique, “the platforms should be thought of as infrastructure, in the same category as electricity providers, railroads, or telecoms.”&#13;
&#13;
An interesting concept which is based on data extraction and its control.&#13;

It's time for a new approach: life-centricity. 95% of both B2C and B2B executives told that they believe their customers are changing faster than they can change their businesses.&#13;
&#13;
Accenture's research has found that businesses focused on life centricity are 𝟯𝘅 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 likely to outperform peers on speed-to-market and almost 𝟱𝘅 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 likely to outperform on customer lifetime value.&#13;
&#13;
After years of global volatility, companies need new strategies to thrive amid the upheaval. Meanwhile, people are becoming increasingly unpredictable as economic, social, environmental and political forces push them to continuously reassess their values and decisions.&#13;
&#13;
Many are turning to technology to reshape their operations, but finding it isn’t enough: Though nearly all executives are accelerating their digital transformations, an astounding 97% acknowledge that, at best, such efforts merely allow them to keep pace, not fuel new growth.&#13;
&#13;
The research, however, discovered an interesting discovery: some companies are beginning to break out. The highest growth companies in our study are widening their strategic aperture, transforming in ways that position them to drive new growth and relevance. They’re using technology more creatively to solve emerging customer needs. Most importantly, our analysis found that companies gaining momentum are not using strategies that are product-centric, or customer-centric—they are becoming life-centric.&#13;
&#13;
A life-centric approach is built on understanding that people are multifaceted and that they embrace their own complexity. It involves keeping a finger on the pulse of the external forces that impact modern life (whether economic, social, cultural or beyond) and finding ways to respond that create value for all. Companies with life-centric strategies are willing to make bold, creative changes to the heart of what they do, whether that means upending business models and internal operations or reimagining who their customers are.&#13;

The real game-changers? How a company is built, managed, and organized. &#13;
&#13;
These factors decide if a company really stands out. There are five key stages in becoming a fully digital company:&#13;
&#13;
• Traditional Model - Starting point, with very little digital.&#13;
• Bridge Model - Teams start to work together, with some digital projects.&#13;
• Hubs Model - A special team leads digital work, but not everyone is involved yet.&#13;
• Platform Model - Digital is a big part of how the company works, used by everyone.&#13;
• Native Model - Digital is at the heart of everything the company does.&#13;

𝗗𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹-𝗙𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁 𝗕𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝘆&#13;
Today, every company is a tech company. By integrating tech into your business strategy, you not only cut costs but also set a clear path for growth. Your tech choices today are crucial for future success.&#13;
&#13;
𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗺𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀&#13;
Adapting new digital methods is essential for business agility and success. Start by asking what your customers and employees need. This can lead to better customer service, cloud adoption, and sustainable practices across your business.&#13;
&#13;
𝗔𝗴𝗶𝗹𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗖𝘂𝗹𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲&#13;
Rapid change and rising customer expectations make agility a must. Many companies misdirect their tech investments due to a lack of focus on innovation. Effective digital transformation shifts this perspective, viewing tech as an enabler and people as adaptable.&#13;
&#13;
𝗙𝗹𝗲𝘅𝗶𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝗖𝗼𝗿𝗲&#13;
Don't get stuck with one technology. Being agile lets you innovate and form partnerships that scale your business quickly. A modular tech approach keeps you adaptable and customer-centric.&#13;
&#13;
𝗣𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲-𝗖𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁&#13;
Digital transformation touches every part of a business. Success needs a strong digital foundation, backed by leadership and a culture open to tech adoption. Key issues like the future of work and role evolution need addressing. Skilled leadership and an upskilled workforce are essential, especially in a remote environment.&#13;
&#13;
Digital transformation is as much about people as it is about technology. Align your culture and skills to make the most of your digital plans.&#13;

It would be comforting to think that we will all have sufficient time to adjust to the changes coming with generative AI. However, much like a foreshock can presage a large earthquake, this new epoch could be a precursor to one even more significant event, the coming 𝗔𝗜 𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘂𝗹𝗮𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆. &#13;
&#13;
AI singularity refers to two concepts: &#13;
1. The first defines “singularity” as a point when AI surpasses human intelligence, leading to rapid and exponential technological advancements. &#13;
2. The second refers to a belief that the technology will be able to improve itself at an accelerating rate, leading to a point where technological progress becomes so fast that it exceeds the human ability to understand or predict it. &#13;

PdM is more than just fixing machines; it's about smart investment in technology that predicts equipment failures before they occur. This approach yields tangible financial benefits:&#13;
&#13;
• 𝗥𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗰𝗲𝗱 𝗖𝗼𝘀𝘁𝘀: Implementing PdM can lead to 12-18% cost reduction, compared to traditional maintenance methods (Brightly Software)​​. For industries like manufacturing, energy, and mining, these savings are substantial, considering the high cost of unplanned downtime.&#13;
 &#13;
• 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝗨𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗘𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆: Industries report 10-20% increased equipment uptime with PdM (Deloitte)​​. This means more productive hours and less time lost to breakdowns.&#13;
 &#13;
• 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗶𝗰 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲 𝗔𝗹𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Predictive Maintenance facilitates better inventory management and resource allocation. The data-driven approach leads to more accurate forecasting and utilization, reducing unnecessary expenses.&#13;
 &#13;
• 𝗟𝗼𝗻𝗴-𝗧𝗲𝗿𝗺 𝗥𝗢𝗜: The investment in PdM technology pays off in the long run. Businesses can expect savings of 18-25% in maintenance expenditures and additional benefits in increased uptime (ATS)​​.&#13;

The use of sensors, wearables, analytics, and Machine Learning (ML), as well as advanced manufacturing, Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR), advanced computer numerical control, and robotics have improved products in multiple ways. Industries have moved from rapid prototyping and testing to adding connectivity features to unconnected products along with innovative features. &#13;
&#13;
Organisations are now moving towards monetising the data that they capture via smart products and bundle services in addition to physical assets. Digital signals from consumer interactions with connected assets on the field or from the assets themselves can enable better services and improve warranty claims, visibility into usage patterns, and overall revenue streams. &#13;
&#13;
To utilise these opportunities arising from Industry 4.0, it is necessary to shift from traditional to novel business models. &#13;
&#13;
Smart products present a spectrum of new business model innovations to capture value. For example, there has been a recent shift from traditional ownership models (where customer benefits from the product delivered) to a Product-as-a-Service model (PaaS), where the manufacturer retains ownership and takes full responsibility for the costs of product operation, maintenance, and service in return for a fixed fee. This enables customers to pay as they go. Here, the value from the improvement in product performance, reduction in the overall cost of production, and higher service efficiency are captured by the manufacturer.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
In just 24 months, we’ve seen a decade’s worth of transformation, much of it driven by emerging technologies, such as data analytics, AI, blockchain and Web 3.0. Meanwhile, the likes of voice recognition, neural networks and cognitive systems, all of which have been talked about since the 1980s, now have both the computing power and cost of storage required to unlock their full innovative potential.&#13;
&#13;
For manufacturers, the impact has been — and will continue to be — considerable. Why? Because it’s led them to move away from traditional formulas of success. Rather than focus on areas like productivity and efficiency, these new tools and technologies have let them start asking a range of different, often better questions such as “What are we doing to digitize R&amp;D?”, ‘’How can we develop connected products and services?” and “What steps should we take to digitize our workforce?”.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
With limited resources at hand, companies need to stay smart and efficient when it comes to investing in innovation.&#13;
&#13;
This is a challenging time for many companies. On the one hand, supply chain disruption, labour shortage, raw material and energy price hikes are driving up business costs. On the other, demand is slack due to consumers’ reduced purchasing power and an uncertain global economic outlook. Together these conditions squeeze companies’ profits and cast a shadow on their #growth prospects. In this time of difficulty, executives around the world find it more urgent than ever to sharpen their organisations’ innovation #strategy to create new markets for growth.&#13;
&#13;
Economics has long taught us that R&amp;D and technology advances, as measured by R&amp;D spending and numbers of patents, are the central drivers of innovation and growth. But market creation for growth is not inevitably about technological innovation.&#13;
&#13;
With limited resources at hand, companies need to stay smart and efficient when it comes to investing in innovation. If technologies are involved, they should enable and facilitate the delivery of key buyer value elements, instead of making products or services too futuristic, esoteric or complicated for customers to adopt.&#13;
&#13;
Is your #innovation strategy anchored to #value?&#13;

&#13;
The right applications of technology can lead to more empowered decision-making; new opportunities for upskilling, reskilling, and cross-functional collaboration; better talent attraction and retention; and improved workplace safety and employee satisfaction.&#13;
&#13;
Customers see the impacts through reduced manufacturing lead times, right-first-time launch management, and improved customer service and complexity management. And, of course, there are the win–win advantages associated with reduced environmental impact, made possible through lower emissions and reduced waste and more efficient energy, water, and raw-material consumption.&#13;
&#13;
These productivity, process, and people improvements are not easy to accomplish—especially across a network of individual manufacturing sites, each with its own site leadership, IT infrastructure, and workplace culture. It is not uncommon to hear of companies achieving impressive results through pilot programs at one factory site only to find themselves unable to replicate these local wins across their network.&#13;
&#13;
The digitally enabled factory of today looks very different from the leading factory of ten years ago. Advances in data and analytics, AI, and ML—and the array of technology vendors in the market—mean manufacturers can choose from hundreds of potential solutions and tech applications to improve their ways of working.&#13;
&#13;
Implemented successfully, these solutions deliver irresistible returns.

To drive business resilience, growth, and profits, organizations need to couple radical efficiency with innovation and invest shrewdly in digital.&#13;
&#13;
Smart budget trade-offs, savvy talent strategies, and optimal digital investments will be key to success this year, with organizations focusing on driving margin improvement, generating cash, increasing the productivity of people and assets, and capitalizing on new growth opportunities with fewer resources.&#13;
&#13;
But to succeed, executives must tackle three variables that threaten to weigh down growth and profits in 2023: higher interest rates, lack of available talent, and lagging digital transformation. Higher funding costs reduce ROI and funding is harder to get and justify as investors prioritize investments that generate short-term profitability and cash flow over those that drive future growth. Critical talent, especially those with digital skills, remains expensive and in short supply, despite the slew of layoffs in the tech sector. Boards and CEOs now expect to see top or bottom-line benefits from digital investments, but many CIOs still struggle to demonstrate the business value of IT.&#13;
&#13;
To differentiate performance in 2023, executives need to manage resources and spend strategically, be agile in securing digital talent, and accelerate key digital and technology initiatives. The recession playbook of nine winning actions that Gartner recommended in mid-2022 holds true, with a focus on driving digital transformation success.&#13;

&#13;
Cloud adoption has rocketed as companies seek computing and storage resources that can be scaled up and down in response to changing business needs. But even given the cost and agility upsides to the cloud, there’s rising interest in yet another deployment model — edge computing, which is computing that’s done at or near the source of the data. It can empower new use cases, especially the innovative artificial intelligence and machine learning applications that are critical to modern business success.&#13;
&#13;
The promise of the edge comes down to data, according to MIT Sloan School of Management. Specifically, there is a need to gather, process, and analyze data closest to where it’s being generated, whether that’s on the factory floor, in an autonomous vehicle, or in a smart building system.&#13;
&#13;
Companies are starting to recognize the role edge computing can play in driving successful data-driven business transformation. Gartner estimates that while only 10% of enterprise data was created and processed outside the data centre and cloud in 2018, this number will be 𝟳𝟱% 𝗯𝘆 𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟱.&#13;

❗The consistent and seamless digitalisation of all the processes forms the basis for automation production. Naturally, this also requires appropriate technologies, production processes and operational and organisational structures.&#13;
&#13;
In addition to cross-company networking and integration across value-added networks, universal standards are also necessary for the technical description and implementation of Industry 4.0. In the "factory of the future", the boundaries between business management software and production management IT will become increasingly blurred. This will allow a decentralised organisation that has the option of implementing flexible and favourable adjustments and expansions.&#13;
&#13;
The focus of the first big data applications concentrated on external consumer data from the internet and social media. Their evaluation held the promise of knowledge and competitive advantages for companies. In-house data remained unused. Since, then, many industrial companies have made massive investments in their IT systems, with result that optimised calculation processes are also possible in real-time. The necessary software already exists. Time and cost savings as well as lower business risk strongly suggest introducing such software. The intention is to derive knowledge for obtaining business advantage from the data that is won. ⚡𝗔 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮-𝗱𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗻 𝗼𝗿𝗴𝗮𝗻𝗶𝘀𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗮𝗹𝘀𝗼 𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘁 𝗶𝘁𝘀 𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗸𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗺𝗮𝗿𝗸𝗲𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴, 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗹𝘆 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘀𝗲𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗰𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗿. ⚡&#13;

&#13;
According to the survey, 67% of people involved in technology-buying decisions are not in IT which means that anyone could be a tech buyer for their organization. In this environment, a new technology adoption chasm is emerging. This new chasm divides organizations that are confident adopters and buyers of technology from the vast majority that are not. &#13;

The pandemic put companies under a tremendous amount of stress. It revealed who is ready for the many changes the near future will bring — and who is not. In times of crisis, this type of readiness doubles as a source of resilience. It reflects how companies can adapt, the robustness of their internal capabilities, and how capable of finding new sources of growth they really are. And the more uncertain the world seems to be, the more important for companies to become future-ready.&#13;
&#13;
Becoming future-ready means scaling up capabilities relevant to future competition. In research by Harvard Business Review, it has been found that a company must make regular shifts in its know-how in order to stay ahead of competitors over the long run. If a company’s know-how stagnates, it will face competition from copycats, fall behind in advancements, and eventually fail.&#13;

&#13;
A timeless manufacturing goal is to produce high-quality products at the lowest possible cost. Industry 4.0 is already proving its worth by allowing manufacturers to achieve their '𝗚𝗼𝗹𝗱𝗲𝗻 𝗕𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵'. Industrial AI and Machine Learning are the primary technologies driving this new wave of ultra-automation.&#13;
&#13;
For manufacturing plants, data has become a valuable resource. Through the use of artificial intelligence, specifically process-based machine learning, manufacturers can use data to significantly impact their bottom line by greatly improving production efficiency, product quality, and employee safety.&#13;
&#13;
While some manufacturers use Predictive Maintenance, it has traditionally been done with SCADA systems that are programmed with human-coded thresholds, alert rules, and configurations.&#13;
&#13;
This semi-manual approach ignores the more complex dynamic behavioural patterns of the machinery, as well as contextual data pertaining to the manufacturing process as a whole. A sensor on a manufacturing machine, for example, may detect a sudden increase in temperature. A static rule-based system would ignore the fact that the machine is being sterilised and proceed to generate a false-positive alert.&#13;
&#13;
Machine Learning algorithms, on the other hand, are fed operational technology data (from the production floor: sensors and SCADA), IT data (contextual data: ERP, quality, MES, and so on), and manufacturing process information describing machine synchronicity and production flow rate.&#13;
&#13;
Algorithms in industrial AI can easily detect anomalies and test correlations while searching for patterns across multiple data feeds. The power of Machine Learning lies in its ability to analyse massive amounts of data in real-time and propose actionable solutions to potential problems.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
The most common way to reduce CO2 emissions is through carbon offset technologies, namely avoided emissions and carbon removal. Though they serve a similar purpose, these two methods are fundamentally different.&#13;
&#13;
One metric ton of CO2 is reduced or avoided for every metric ton of CO2 emitted in avoided emissions. This still leads to a positive increase in emissions overall.&#13;
&#13;
On the other hand, carbon removal technologies completely remove and store one metric ton of CO2 for every metric ton of CO2 emitted.&#13;
&#13;
Carbon removal technologies have a distinct advantage over the avoided emissions. For this reason, they could be the future of CO2 emissions reduction. They are divided into short-term and long-term methods based on the CO2 emissions they can remove and store.&#13;
&#13;
Short-term methods include soil carbon sequestration, reforestation, biochar, wooden buildings, and more. Direct Air Capture with Carbon Storage (DACCS), Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) and enhanced weathering are considered long-term methods.&#13;

&#13;
You know the scenario well: intricate challenges and convoluted processes—what we'll call the 'hairball'—that leaves your strategic initiatives gasping for air. &#13;
&#13;
It's not a glitch; it's a feature of today's complex business landscape. &#13;
&#13;
So, how can leaders cut through this Gordian knot? Here are some unconventional perspectives:&#13;
&#13;
1. 𝗩𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗜𝘀𝗻'𝘁 𝗘𝗻𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵; 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗡𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝗮 𝗕𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗹𝗲 𝗖𝗿𝘆&#13;
What are you trying to achieve? Why does it matter? Rather than a mere vision, create a battle cry that not only directs but invigorates your entire organization. Make sure this mantra is both measurable and deeply resonant with all stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
2. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿 𝗼𝗳 𝗘𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: 𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗟𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗜𝘀 𝗢𝗳𝘁𝗲𝗻 𝗠𝗼𝗿𝗲&#13;
Conventional wisdom emphasizes more—more features, more offerings, more data. But what if the secret lies in strategic elimination? Identify the core activities that genuinely create value and mercilessly cut away the excess.&#13;
&#13;
3. 𝗘𝗺𝗽𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿 𝘁𝗼 𝗘𝗹𝗲𝘃𝗮𝘁𝗲: 𝗨𝗻𝗹𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗨𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗱 𝗣𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗪𝗶𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻&#13;
Stop babysitting. Start empowering. Your teams should not just have the 'tools' to solve problems; they should have the latitude to make decisions that could redefine your business. Cultivate a culture where accountability isn't a buzzword—it's the norm.&#13;
&#13;
4. 𝗔𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗽𝗮𝘁𝗲, 𝗗𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗝𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗰𝘁: 𝗠𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗠𝗮𝗿𝗸𝗲𝘁 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗬𝗼𝘂&#13;
Understanding your customer is table stakes. The real game is shaping the market according to your strengths. This isn't about meeting expectations; it's about setting them.&#13;
&#13;
5. 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝘆 𝗜𝘀 𝗮 𝗟𝗶𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗘𝗻𝘁𝗶𝘁𝘆—𝗧𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁 𝗜𝘁 𝗧𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗪𝗮𝘆&#13;
Monitoring isn't enough; you need to breathe life into your strategy. This involves a continuous loop of adaptation and feedback, rooted in analytics that delve deeper than surface-level metrics.&#13;
&#13;
📌 The question isn't whether you'll confront complexity, but how you'll turn it to your advantage for sustainable growth and differentiation.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
But there are also many other scenarios where digital twins are used as a way to measure and improve the performance of an existing product.&#13;
&#13;
A digital twin is a virtual representation that serves as the real-time digital counterpart of a physical object or process. The virtual twin is disrupting the entire product lifecycle management (PLM), from design to manufacturing to service and operations. The logic behind this is that any time there is a link between physical objects and processes, the potential for performance improvement exists.&#13;
&#13;
Digital twins can provide enterprises with cost benefits by&#13;
• reducing machine downtime,&#13;
• decreasing inventory holding costs,&#13;
• improving efficiency,&#13;
• increasing quality,&#13;
• empowering customers,&#13;
• saving space,&#13;
• improving productivity,&#13;
• saving energy,&#13;
• improving process automation,&#13;
• expanding market reach by providing more value for customers at lower costs than traditional solutions such as paper-based records which consume up to 80% of all energy produced during their production cycle;&#13;
• lowering purchase price tags by enabling smaller organizations to deal primarily with small volumes.&#13;

A digital roadmap is a plan that outlines the steps and actions your organization needs to take to achieve its digital goals. It should align with your overall business strategy and take into account the current state of your organization's digital capabilities, as well as the external factors that may impact your progress.&#13;
&#13;
A strategic approach is crucial when creating a digital roadmap. This means identifying your organization's digital goals and objectives and aligning them with your overall business strategy. It's also important to take into account the current state of your organization's digital capabilities and identify any gaps that need to be addressed.&#13;
&#13;
To create a digital roadmap, it's also important to involve internal stakeholders, including key decision-makers, IT, and other departments. This will help ensure buy-in and support for the roadmap, and also provide valuable insights into the current state of your organization's digital capabilities.&#13;
&#13;
There are several frameworks available to help organizations create a digital roadmap. One popular framework is the SOSTAC model, which stands for Situation, Objectives, Strategy, Tactics, Actions, and Control. &#13;
&#13;
When creating a digital roadmap, it's also important to consider best-case scenarios and how to achieve them. This could include identifying potential partnerships or collaborations that could help accelerate your progress or identifying the latest technologies that could help drive innovation and competitiveness.&#13;
&#13;
It's important to note that a digital roadmap is not a one-time project, but rather an ongoing process that should be reviewed and updated regularly. This will help ensure that it stays aligned with your organization's goals and objectives, and takes into account any external factors that may impact your progress. Also, it's important to communicate the digital roadmap to all stakeholders, including employees, partners, and customers. This will help ensure buy-in and support for the roadmap, and also provide valuable insights into the current state of your organization's digital capabilities.&#13;
&#13;
By taking a strategic approach, involving key stakeholders, and utilizing frameworks such as SOSTAC or Agile methodology, organizations can create a roadmap that aligns with their overall business strategy and takes into account the current state of their digital capabilities. &#13;

Gartner &#13;
&#13;
To increase the resilience of products, services, and systems, a digital immune system (DIS) combines practises and technologies from observability, artificial intelligence (AI)-augmented testing, chaos engineering, auto remediation, site reliability engineering, and software supply chain security.&#13;
&#13;
A DIS provides a model to help your organisation prepare for potential risks and to use failures as learning opportunities to create a superior customer and user experience that is resilient to failures.&#13;
&#13;
A DIS can be used as a guideline for investing in a set of practises to improve the quality and resilience of mission-critical systems. The development and evolution of a DIS results in a more resilient business outcome and adds value to both business and IT stakeholders. &#13;
&#13;
As a result, you will be able to play an important role in connecting software development to business outcomes and supporting customer experience strategies using cutting-edge technologies and practises.&#13;

&#13;
1. Operational Efficiency: It's not just about cost-cutting; it's about smarter, leaner processes that elevate production quality. This is where your transformation journey gains traction.&#13;
   &#13;
2. Customer Engagement: Your client interactions need to evolve. Training employees in social media proficiency isn't an option; it's a necessity for modern business success.&#13;
   &#13;
3. Employee Engagement &amp; Retention: The alignment of your company's vision with the aspirations of your workforce is crucial. It's a silent yet powerful metric of transformation success.&#13;
   &#13;
4. Value Creation: Enhancing your product or service offerings isn't just a goal, it's a testament to your transformation's effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
These four metrics are not just indicators - they're the drivers of a truly competitive edge. &#13;

The sector remains extremely dynamic, with more than 200 players competing to develop new hardware, software, and materials.&#13;
&#13;
Rapid innovation is driving major improvements in the performance of AM technologies. The newest generations of machines are overcoming many of the perceived limitations of their predecessors, such as by allowing the production of overhanging parts without the need for elaborate printed support structures, or creating stronger parts by controlling the alignment of fiber reinforcements using magnetic fields. The range of materials available for AM systems continues to expand, including high-strength aluminum alloys and medical-grade polymers.&#13;
&#13;
AM systems are getting faster, too. Recent systems based on selective laser sintering (SLS), for example, use as many as one million laser diodes to accelerate the production of parts. And improvements to software and postprocessing technologies are further streamlining the end-to-end journey from concept to finished component. AM technologies pair very well with generative-design systems, which use AI techniques to define and optimize the geometry of parts.&#13;
&#13;
In many sectors, AM has become widely accepted as the fastest and most cost-effective way to produce functional prototypes during product development and testing. AM technologies are also being applied in a growing range of “indirect” applications, including tooling, spare parts, and fixtures for conventional manufacturing machines.&#13;

Agile businesses, particularly start-ups, seem to turn on a dime and don't appear to have any kind of plan. It's easy to believe that what you see an agile firm doing - acting quickly, maintaining a high tempo, and being highly responsive - is all there is.&#13;
&#13;
𝘞𝘩𝘺 𝘪𝘵’𝘴 𝘸𝘳𝘰𝘯𝘨&#13;
It is not a strategy to be agile. It is a capability, although a very valuable one with immediate operational benefits, it cannot permanently affect a firm's competitive position unless the right decisions are made about where to direct that capability. And the apparent lack of a plan does not imply that successful start-ups lack strategies. A strategy is not a plan; it is a decision-making framework, a set of guiding principles that can be applied as the situation evolves. Most businesses fail because being able to turn on a dime does not guarantee that you will turn in the right direction. Successful start-ups spend a lot of time debating fundamentals and asking tough questions.&#13;
&#13;
Successful start-ups do a lot of hard thinking about fundamentals, questioning and testing basic assumptions with the rigour that incumbents would do well to imitate. Start-ups must do so because their resources are extremely limited. If they do not have a coherent strategy, they will make poor resource allocation decisions, which will result in death rather than a drop in earnings.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Where traditional factories and even smart factories require some direct human interaction, true lights-out factories operate completely autonomously.&#13;
&#13;
Though it might sound like a dream, lights-out factories are fully automated, 24/7 factories with no on-floor human presence. And they already exist in the modern world.&#13;
&#13;
Japanese robotics designer FANUC has been using robots to build themselves in a lights-out factory for 20 years, and even electronics company Philips uses 128 robots in a lights-out manufacturing line to produce electric razors.&#13;
&#13;
One industry that uses lights-out manufacturing extensively in semiconductor manufacturing. ASE Global, the world’s leading provider of semiconductor manufacturing services in assembly and testing, used 18 completely automated factories in 2020 alone.&#13;
&#13;
Which industries will implement lights-out manufacturing? Robot installations since 2019 show that the automotive, electronics, and metal and machinery sectors are unsurprisingly leading the way in Industry 4.0 implementation.&#13;

Many companies have invested heavily in digital transformation, but despite the projected $6.8 trillion spent by 2023, they often fail to see the expected return on investment. This is due to a lack of understanding of the steps required for a successful transformation.&#13;
&#13;
Buying technology and investing in the latest tech tools is not enough to drive change. It's crucial to have the right processes, culture, and talent in place to fully utilize these tools. The failure to invest in skills development is a significant contributor to the lack of productivity gains from new technologies like AI. Convincing experienced employees and senior managers to embrace new tech tools can also be a challenge for many organizations.&#13;
&#13;
Many companies have fallen into the trap of thinking that technology alone will drive change. But the reality is, without the right processes, culture, and talent in place, even the best technology will fail to deliver results.&#13;

Some people have an overly positive or negative view of its potential.&#13;
&#13;
1. 𝗕𝗶𝗴 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗶𝘀 𝗺𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗵𝘆𝗽𝗲. Some believe that big data is just a lot of information that data experts can only understand. However, it's actually quite complex due to the variety, velocity, and veracity of the data involved. When used properly, big data can provide valuable insights.&#13;
   &#13;
2. 𝗕𝗶𝗴 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝘀𝗼𝗹𝘃𝗲𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘁𝗶𝗰𝘀 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗲. In reality, not every problem merits a big data approach. Careful alignment of methods to needs is required.&#13;
   &#13;
3. 𝗕𝗶𝗴 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗳𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲. While big data can help make predictions about the future, the accuracy of those predictions is highly dependent on the quality of the input data. They should be seen as directional rather than absolute.&#13;
   &#13;
4. 𝗢𝗻𝗹𝘆 𝗹𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗿𝗽𝗼𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝗯𝗶𝗴 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮. As the cost of solutions decreases, they become more accessible to organizations of all sizes.&#13;
   &#13;
5. 𝗕𝗶𝗴 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗯𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝗺𝗲𝘀𝘀𝘆 𝗶𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀. the quality of insights derived from big data is heavily dependent on the quality of the data itself. Good data governance and quality are essential for accurate insights.&#13;
&#13;
By understanding the capabilities and limitations of big data, organizations of any size can efficiently extract valuable insights from it and make informed decisions.&#13;

In the near future, AI-based systems will be able to continuously monitor equipment, identify potential problems and recommend or take corrective actions to prevent failures. This will enable organizations to move from a traditional, reactive approach to maintenance (known as corrective maintenance) to a predictive or even preventive approach. The benefits of AI-based predictive maintenance are significant.&#13;
&#13;
A study by McKinsey &amp; Company estimated that AI could enable a 15 per cent reduction in maintenance costs and a 5 per cent to 10 per cent improvement in equipment uptime. The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) estimates that AI could help organizations achieve $1.5 trillion in additional value from increased productivity and reduced downtime in the global industrial sector by 2030. And a recent Gartner study found that AI-based maintenance could reduce downtime by 25 per cent, while also reducing maintenance costs by 30 per cent.&#13;

&#13;
Based on its experience with industrial clients, MIT Sloan School of Management has developed a strategy to avoid falling into the trap of purchasing technology that is underutilised or fails to deliver the desired business outcomes. It is recommended for a more gradual transition process that incorporates systems thinking and addresses cultural norms.&#13;
&#13;
This will translate lofty Industry 4.0 visions into actionable strategies and next steps to improve internal processes. The following are important steps:&#13;
&#13;
The initial stages of transformation will be driven by 𝗳𝗼𝗰𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝗻 𝗰𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺𝘀. Manufacturers frequently install networks of hundreds of sensors and then return to solve a specific problem. Problems are not solved by technology. In fact, technology has the potential to exacerbate problems by increasing data overload and eroding employees' trust in the new system.&#13;
&#13;
Instead of launching a full-scale network with hundreds of sensors, a more cautious approach that focuses on a specific problem and uses Industry 4.0 capabilities to solve it is recommended. Engaging employees to identify critical stress points in their jobs, as well as evaluating processes to identify opportunities for improvement and value creation, is critical for larger transformation.&#13;
&#13;
Begin by "𝘀𝗲𝗲𝗶𝗻𝗴" 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗳𝗲𝗲𝗱𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗹𝗼𝗼𝗽𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗺𝗶𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴. Knowing where to establish a feedback loop is critical to the business value of Industry 4.0, but the question is where to begin. The hunt for hidden factories can be fruitful because it allows you to listen to the system and identify the most significant gaps. It is also critical to implement processes that reduce the time between measurement and action. Data collected in a database or spreadsheet is insufficient to drive change.&#13;
&#13;
𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗱𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘄𝗵𝗶𝗹𝗲 𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝘂𝗻𝘀𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺𝘀. The implementation of new technologies such as sensors, cloud platforms, and advanced algorithms can provide workers with new insights. However, as soon as they encounter problems or complex and unwieldy systems, they will revert to old systems and traditional ways of working.&#13;
&#13;
Workers can more easily digest new systems and adjust to new work patterns if Industry 4.0 initiatives are tightly scoped and incremental. Simultaneously, old systems must be removed to eliminate fallback options.&#13;

For this issue I have written an article on How can digitalisation contribute to the growth of European market. &#13;
&#13;
"The digital transformation of Europe’s economies and societies is accelerating. It is entering the next stage, propelled by a convergence of technologies that is gradually blurring the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres and pushing the limits of what computers can do. These innovative technologies, and the new business models they create, building on the use of data, are progressively coming to maturity for at-scale deployment, and will increasingly impact all sectors of the European economy.&#13;
&#13;
Until recently, the adoption of digital technologies was regarded as critical to market success and was usually linked with the most forward-thinking and cutting-edge businesses. Now, however, the pandemic has made the digital transformation critical to companies’ survival. Many of the digitalisation-related innovations, such as remote services, work-from-anywhere, and online collaboration, are expected to stay. Investment in digitalisation is vital to preventing business disruption, organising work remotely, improving communication with customers, suppliers and employees and selling products and services online. We live in times when understanding and recognition of the importance of digital transformation is shaping the future of our lives and doing business. "&#13;

Artificial intelligence (AI) is reimagining the business world, boosting innovation and productivity, and helping organizations think bigger. Organizations can use AI to improve their products, processes and decision-making. Using the technology available today, organizations should be able to achieve organizational agility powered by AI.&#13;
&#13;
The impact of artificial intelligence is being felt across all industries. There are multiple examples of implementing AI in the supply chain, transportation, education, operations, marketing, and almost every industry that’s moving toward digitalization and switching from manual activities to technology-assisted ones. With the help of AI, companies are better equipped to fight disasters using AI decision-making algorithms, detect anomalies and predict future behaviour. AI enhances automation and reduces the human-intensive labour and tediousness involved in forecasting and prediction analysis.&#13;
&#13;
Some experts say the evolution or maturity of artificial intelligence can be divided into three stages: The first is assisted intelligence, where humans get insights from data and take action based on it. It is pure data-driven decision-making. The second stage is augmented intelligence, which takes the data processing a bit further.&#13;
&#13;
In the coming years, AI will probably reach the third stage, the point of full automation. All processes and activities will be completely digitized and automated through workflows, and machines, bots and systems will act directly upon intelligence derived from them.&#13;

&#13;
As technology continues to evolve at a rapid pace, it’s important for companies to ensure that their employees have the necessary skills to keep up with these changes. Upskilling involves helping workers adapt their more traditional skills and capabilities to modern technologies that underpin digital transformation efforts, while reskilling provides employees with new skills. &#13;
&#13;
Investing in digital transformation and skills training pays off as 66% of employers expect to get ROI for upskilling and reskilling within one year. CEOs who introduce upskilling programs see increased productivity, improvement in talent acquisition and retention and a more resilient workforce.&#13;
&#13;
In the recent 2023 Global Global Survey by PwC it is noticeable that CEOs are considering upskilling the company's workforce as one of the key components of the success and sustainable growth of the companies.]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 14 Apr 2023 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Post 678</title><link>https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:share:6993934525093302274</link><description>&lt;![CDATA[Are you aware of transformation illusions?

&#13;
According to Accenture, data-driven companies are propelled by four key drivers. They:&#13;
&#13;
1) Establish a solid data foundation: Achieved through an agile data supply chain with cloud-based and scalable platforms. &#13;
&#13;
2) Ensure data is secure, relevant and trustworthy: Accomplished through robust data governance, metadata management and data veracity solutions. This is enabled by machine learning (ML) or artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, right people structures and processes. Only a third of firms trusted their data enough to use it effectively and derive value from it.&#13;
&#13;
3) Create an analytics strategy: Attained by focusing on augmenting human efforts with AI and by building capabilities in advanced analytics. Almost 90 per cent of data-driven champions in the survey could attest to being highly involved in data analytics processes and automated approaches as opposed to 54 per cent of others.&#13;
&#13;
4) Envision and launch new data-driven services: Realized through innovative business models and operational efficiency measures. Using a data value scorecard, business outcomes can be measured, tracked and reported effectively.&#13;

&#13;
Based on its experience with industrial clients, MIT Sloan School of Management has developed a strategy to avoid falling into the trap of purchasing technology that is underutilised or fails to deliver the desired business outcomes. It is recommended for a more gradual transition process that incorporates systems thinking and addresses cultural norms.&#13;
&#13;
This will translate lofty Industry 4.0 visions into actionable strategies and next steps to improve internal processes. The following are important steps:&#13;
&#13;
The initial stages of transformation will be driven by 𝗳𝗼𝗰𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝗻 𝗰𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺𝘀. Manufacturers frequently install networks of hundreds of sensors and then return to solve a specific problem. Problems are not solved by technology. In fact, technology has the potential to exacerbate problems by increasing data overload and eroding employees' trust in the new system.&#13;
&#13;
Instead of launching a full-scale network with hundreds of sensors, a more cautious approach that focuses on a specific problem and uses Industry 4.0 capabilities to solve it is recommended. Engaging employees to identify critical stress points in their jobs, as well as evaluating processes to identify opportunities for improvement and value creation, is critical for larger transformation.&#13;
&#13;
Begin by "𝘀𝗲𝗲𝗶𝗻𝗴" 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗳𝗲𝗲𝗱𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗹𝗼𝗼𝗽𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗺𝗶𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴. Knowing where to establish a feedback loop is critical to the business value of Industry 4.0, but the question is where to begin. The hunt for hidden factories can be fruitful because it allows you to listen to the system and identify the most significant gaps. It is also critical to implement processes that reduce the time between measurement and action. Data collected in a database or spreadsheet is insufficient to drive change.&#13;
&#13;
𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗱𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘄𝗵𝗶𝗹𝗲 𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝘂𝗻𝘀𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺𝘀. The implementation of new technologies such as sensors, cloud platforms, and advanced algorithms can provide workers with new insights. However, as soon as they encounter problems or complex and unwieldy systems, they will revert to old systems and traditional ways of working.&#13;
&#13;
Workers can more easily digest new systems and adjust to new work patterns if Industry 4.0 initiatives are tightly scoped and incremental. Simultaneously, old systems must be removed to eliminate fallback options.&#13;

Often, those actions involve what’s commonly called “digital transformation”—implementing new tools, platforms, and business models to create competitive differentiation. &#13;
&#13;
But while CEOs constantly hear that they should lead any significant digital transformation, it’s not always easy to know exactly how to do that. As technology continues to grow in complexity, it is harder for CEOs to take a direct role in leading these transformations. At the same time, intensifying environmental disruption makes transformation an increasingly strategic lever that CEOs must lead. &#13;
&#13;
So, what’s a CEO to do?&#13;

All three are immediate, headline-grabbing issues that can reinforce and compound one another. When looking into 5 year period, the picture changes for CEOs medium-term outlook. Over that time frame, cyber risks, and climate change join inflation, macroeconomic volatility  and geopolitical conflict as the top-tier risks. &#13;
&#13;
CEOs have an essential role to play in staying ahead of cyber challenges. According to PwC's recent research, it was indicated that the critical contributor to the cybersecurity improvements at leading companies was a C-suite collaboration to make the most of sustained, cumulative investments in risk mitigation and understanding the latest technology and how to utilize them. &#13;

&#13;
Instead, the architectural, managerial, and organizational approaches to transformation best explain the substantial and enduring differences among firms. We found that companies typically progress through five stages on their transformation journey:&#13;
&#13;
• Traditional model&#13;
• Bridge model&#13;
• Hubs model&#13;

This can make it difficult to integrate new digital technologies on top of legacy systems via APIs to innovate new services and experiences. A more efficient option for achieving legacy modernization is fully automated migration, which uses refactoring technology to convert legacy code and data to modern platforms. However, as per McKinsey &amp; Company research, only 16% of respondents say their organizations’ digital transformations have successfully improved performance and also equipped them to sustain changes in the long term. An additional 7% say that performance improved but that those improvements were not sustained.&#13;
&#13;
The importance of digital transformation in today’s business world cannot be overstated. Companies that fail to adapt to new technologies risk being left behind by their competitors. Digital transformation can help companies improve their operations, increase efficiency, reduce costs, and provide better customer experiences. However, it’s important for companies to approach digital transformation strategically and with a clear understanding of their goals and objectives. This includes identifying areas where digital transformation can have the greatest impact, developing a roadmap for implementation, and investing in upskilling and reskilling employees.&#13;

&#13;
Such a culture is required for the successful implementation of a Big Data strategy. According to this roadmap, the best way to get started with Big Data is to first understand what it is and what it can do for your organisation, and then work with a multidisciplinary team to develop Proof of Concepts. These initial Proof of Concepts are critical for your company's data-driven transformation and should be shared with all employees.&#13;
&#13;
Knowledgent's infographic below depicts five levels of Big Data maturity within an organisation. The first level is referred to as the Infancy phase, and it is the stage at which one begins to understand Big Data and develop Proof of Concepts. &#13;
&#13;
The second level they identified is the technical adoption phase, in which the company prepares to implement various Big Data technologies. These technologies, whether on-premises or in the cloud, will allow a company to develop new Proof of Concepts / products or Big Data services more quickly and effectively.&#13;
&#13;
An organisation enters level 3 of the Big Data maturity index once the IT department is capable of working with Big Data technologies and the business understands what Big Data can do for them. More in-depth analysis of structured and unstructured data available within the company will result in more insights and better decision-making.&#13;
&#13;
Level 4 is where Big Data analytics has become an integral part of the company's culture and has resulted in integrated predictive insights into business operations. This is the final level before becoming a fully data-driven organisation that operates as a "data service provider." Companies that have achieved level 5 of the Big Data maturity index have integrated Big Data analytics at all levels of their organisation, are truly data-driven, and can be considered 'data companies' regardless of the product or service they provide. Based on their Big Data insights, they will significantly outperform their competitors.&#13;
&#13;
⚡All businesses should strive for Big Data maturity level 5 because it will lead to better decision-making, better products, and better service.&#13;

You might also be experiencing the symptoms of what is called the "Monolith Syndrome", a condition where your technology team cannot deliver the features and performance that your business needs.&#13;
&#13;
The "Monolith Syndrome" is caused by having a single codebase and a single database that was developed years ago and has not evolved much since. This makes it hard to scale, test, deploy and maintain your application. It also creates bottlenecks, outages and bugs that frustrate your customers and employees.&#13;
&#13;
The solution to the "Monolith Syndrome" is to undergo a digital transformation, where you refactor your monolith into microservices. Microservices are small, independent and loosely coupled units of functionality that communicate through APIs. They allow you to develop, deploy and scale your application faster, easier and more reliably.&#13;

&#13;
The effect of digitization on a country’s economy is highly visible. In the 150 countries covered by the study of Booz &amp; Company. an increase in digitization of 10 percentage points triggered a 0.50 to 0.62 percent gain in per capita GDP. &#13;
&#13;
The more advanced the country, the greater the impact of digitization appears to be, which establishes a virtuous feedback cycle: A country reinforces and accelerates its own progress as it moves along the line. &#13;
&#13;
Digitization also has a significant impact on job creation: A 10 percent increase in digitization reduces a nation’s unemployment rate by 0.84 percent. This is an especially critical finding for emerging markets, which will need to create hundreds of millions of jobs in the coming decade to ensure that a booming population of young people can contribute to their national economy. &#13;

Finally, a 10-point increase in digitization has, on average, led to a six-point increase in the country’s score on the INSEAD Global Innovation Index, which ranks countries according to innovation potential.

The use of sensors, wearables, analytics, and Machine Learning (ML), as well as advanced manufacturing, Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR), advanced computer numerical control, and robotics have improved products in multiple ways. Industries have moved from rapid prototyping and testing to adding connectivity features to unconnected products along with innovative features. &#13;
&#13;
Organisations are now moving towards monetising the data that they capture via smart products and bundle services in addition to physical assets. Digital signals from consumer interactions with connected assets on the field or from the assets themselves can enable better services and improve warranty claims, visibility into usage patterns, and overall revenue streams. &#13;
&#13;
To utilise these opportunities arising from Industry 4.0, it is necessary to shift from traditional to novel business models. &#13;
&#13;
Smart products present a spectrum of new business model innovations to capture value. For example, there has been a recent shift from traditional ownership models (where the customer benefits from the product delivered) to a Product-as-a-Service model (PaaS), where the manufacturer retains ownership and takes full responsibility for the costs of product operation, maintenance, and service in return for a fixed fee. This enables customers to pay as they go. Here, the value from the improvement in product performance, reduction in the overall cost of production, and higher service efficiency are captured by the manufacturer.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Transparency in operations is vital to businesses today, not just for reining in inefficiencies and waste, but also for troubleshooting work models, identifying areas ripe for training, and generally developing opportunities for improvement. As companies look increasingly at areas to automate—and contemplate spending big sums to do so—the need for such transparency becomes ever more important so that leaders don’t make decisions blindfolded.&#13;
&#13;
How to get starter? According to McKinsey &amp; Company try this:&#13;
&#13;
1. Start with a hypothesis-driven approach regarding where to unlock value. Use the approach to validate (or disprove) a hypothesis: to pinpoint and demonstrate value in a certain area, rather than looking for value in an area that is little understood.&#13;
&#13;
2. Select the right tool for the job. Process insights is less about finding a single platform that will solve all your needs and more about identifying a suite of technologies that can help you understand and manage operations holistically, based on your unique requirements.&#13;
&#13;
3. Embed the technology in an overarching delivery mechanism. The point of process insights is not to showcase analytics. It is most effective, and most valuable, when embedded into an existing initiative, such as automation or continuous improvement.&#13;
&#13;
4.Use process insights to augment—not replace—subject matter expertise. There is only so much information contained in systems and data. The approach and technologies of process insights are no substitute for the knowledge and intuition of frontline employees and specialists. Findings should serve to substantiate (or invalidate) assumptions and help uncover new insights.&#13;

However, there is now a 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗿𝗱 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: 𝗟𝗼𝘄-𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗲/𝗻𝗼-𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 enable organisations to build custom systems without hiring teams of developers or settling for close enough software for administrative tools, workflow or case management systems etc. &#13;
&#13;
Managers must understand how they work and what they are good for in order to make proper use of them: small business transactions, small-scale automation, analytics, and website development are all good use cases.&#13;
&#13;
There are also management issues to consider: the proliferation of applications created by "citizen developers" can lead to a shadow IT problem in which only one user understands how the system works. Department managers should be encouraged to facilitate Low-Code/No-Code development and educated on how the technology works, what tools are supported by the organisation, and the desired relationship between citizen developers and the IT organisation.&#13;
&#13;
These applications do not achieve these benefits by magic; rather, they delegate development to users rather than professional system developers. Users can usually design and implement their individual or departmental systems in a few hours using point-and-click or pull-down menu interfaces.&#13;
&#13;
𝗥𝗼𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 (𝗥𝗣𝗔), for example, is one of the fastest-growing LC/NC system categories. It allows users to design automated workflows that can reach multiple information systems by using rules for simple decision-making. This is ideal for automating administrative processes in the back office.&#13;
&#13;
Low-code workflow or 𝗰𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺𝘀 (a modern take on traditional business process management tools); virtual assistants or chatbot tools; and function-specific marketing tools are other examples of LC/NC tools.&#13;

&#13;
By tracking changes in vibration frequency and amplitude, a predictive maintenance program can enable decision-making to maximize the cost-benefit of allowing a non-essential and easily replaced part to fail, vs. maximizing the run time of a process-critical part. &#13;
&#13;
Many modern vibration sensors include AI/ML technology that interprets the data to help the team make smarter decisions. Before implementing a predictive maintenance program, it's important to consider &#13;
• how the new sensor data will integrate with existing tech and operating processes, &#13;
• the human-based actions that will be driven by the new data, and &#13;
• the automated processes that will be driven across the tech stack to maximize value through integration with purchasing, planning, and maintenance management systems.&#13;

&#13;
Pick up any industry or professional publication and you’ll be deluged with articles extolling the value of digital transformation. Supporters tout new capabilities as do-or-die. “All companies must become tech companies” is a common refrain. “Organizations that speed their decision intelligence capabilities will survive, and those that don’t will fail” is another.&#13;
&#13;
There is an enormous potential for new digital capabilities to improve business performance, create more satisfying jobs, and solve some long-standing issues that have proven beyond the reach of methods typically employed today.&#13;
&#13;
Still, adaptation and change remain challenges for most companies. All change, even the smallest, depends on trust. The problem is that, too often, business departments simply do not trust their IT counterparts. Until this problem is tackled and solved, critical initiatives around digital transformation will stall.&#13;

&#13;
The next generation of SMBs (small and medium-sized businesses) is here, and they are on the rise. Riding on the back of the 2020 work-from-home revolution, digital acceleration, and the great resignation, we saw a new type of founder (and a new type of SMB) rise from the ashes. I know how the whole work-from-home situation affected me and my family which just strengthen my idea and concept of the new way of providing services through a new company.&#13;
&#13;
It is notable that the flexibility of work-from-home (WFH) is driving SMB growth. Accenture's report shows that many of the respondents who started their company within the past three-year period cited the ability to work remotely as a key motivating factor. In fact, 64% of these professionals indicated that starting their business would not have been possible without the WFH option.&#13;
&#13;
Also, 35% of SMB founders are now pursuing their business as a "side-hustle" in addition to their existing employment income. This was particularly the case in 2020 when 42% of SMBs were started as a side business.&#13;

&#13;
Data leaders should consider seven actions to enable companies to scale their generative AI ambitions.&#13;
&#13;
📌The research by McKinsey shows that generative AI can bring in $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion in annual benefits across 63 use uses. Data is at the core of this.&#13;
&#13;
This presents a challenge for Chief Data Officers (CDOs) as 72% of top organizations find data management a barrier to scaling AI.&#13;
&#13;
To tackle this, CDOs and data leaders should focus on these seven actions as they go from testing to full-scale generative AI implementation:&#13;
&#13;
1. 𝗟𝗲𝘁 𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗲 𝗯𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗴𝘂𝗶𝗱𝗲. CDOs need to be clear about where the value is and what data is needed to deliver it.&#13;
   &#13;
2. 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗰𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝘀𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗯𝗿𝗼𝗮𝗱𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝘂𝘀𝗲 𝗰𝗮𝘀𝗲𝘀. Build relevant capabilities (such as vector databases and data pre- and post-processing pipelines) into the existing data architecture, particularly supporting unstructured data.&#13;
   &#13;
3. 𝗙𝗼𝗰𝘂𝘀 𝗼𝗻 𝗸𝗲𝘆 𝗽𝗼𝗶𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲 𝗰𝘆𝗰𝗹𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗲𝗻𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗵𝗶𝗴𝗵 𝗾𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆. Develop multiple interventions—both human and automated—into the data life cycle from source to consumption to ensure the quality of all material data, including unstructured data.&#13;
   &#13;
4. 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘀𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗯𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗱𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗼𝘃𝗲 𝗾𝘂𝗶𝗰𝗸𝗹𝘆 𝗮𝘀 𝗿𝗲𝗴𝘂𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗿𝗴𝗲. Focus on securing the enterprise’s proprietary data and protecting personal information while actively monitoring a fluid regulatory environment.&#13;
   &#13;
5. 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝘂𝗽 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗲𝗻𝘁. Focus on finding the handful of people who are critical to implementing your data program, with a shift toward more data engineers and fewer data scientists.&#13;
   &#13;
6. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗔𝗜 𝘁𝗼 𝗵𝗲𝗹𝗽 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮. Generative AI can accelerate existing tasks and improve how they’re done along the entire data value chain, from data engineering to data governance and data analysis.&#13;
   &#13;
7. 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗼𝗿𝗼𝘂𝘀𝗹𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗲𝗻𝗲 𝗾𝘂𝗶𝗰𝗸𝗹𝘆. Invest in performance and financial measurement, and closely monitor implementations to continuously improve data performance.&#13;

Cloud adoption has rocketed as companies seek computing and storage resources that can be scaled up and down in response to changing business needs. But even given the cost and agility upsides to the cloud, there’s rising interest in yet another deployment model — edge computing, which is computing that’s done at or near the source of the data. It can empower new use cases, especially the innovative artificial intelligence and machine learning applications that are critical to modern business success.&#13;
&#13;
The promise of the edge comes down to data, according to MIT Sloan School of Management. Specifically, there is a need to gather, process, and analyze data closest to where it’s being generated, whether that’s on the factory floor, in an autonomous vehicle, or in a smart building system.&#13;
&#13;
Companies are starting to recognize the role edge computing can play in driving successful data-driven business transformation. Gartner estimates that while only 10% of enterprise data was created and processed outside the data centre and cloud in 2018, this number will be 𝟳𝟱% 𝗯𝘆 𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟱.&#13;

The most in-demand managerial abilities are those that include strategic thinking. Why? Because the direction of a firm can be significantly impacted by workers capable of critical, rational, and strategic thought.&#13;
&#13;
❗The good news is that you can develop your strategic thinking abilities with the appropriate attitude and practice.&#13;
&#13;
⚡Any abilities that help you apply critical thinking to solve complicated problems and make future plans are considered strategic thinking abilities. These abilities are necessary to attain professional goals, get over roadblocks, and deal with hurdles, especially if they are anticipated to take weeks, months, or even years to complete.&#13;
&#13;
Strategic thinking skills include:&#13;
1. Analytical skills&#13;
2. Communication skills&#13;
3. Problem-solving skills&#13;
4. Planning and management skills &#13;
&#13;

One of the simplest things you can do to develop your strategic thinking abilities is to 𝗮𝘀𝗸 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗶𝗰 𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀. By doing this, you may practise your planning abilities, improve your ability to see opportunities and cultivate a more strategic attitude that you can use throughout your career.&#13;
&#13;
You need to intelligently respond to and deal with them. One of the best methods to do this is to 𝗼𝗯𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗿𝗲𝗳𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁 on your current circumstance, making sure that any strategy you come up with is supported by data.&#13;

They often get stuck in pilot mode, where they test new ideas but fail to deliver value. To move beyond pilot mode, they need to align their vision, strategy and execution, adopt agile practices and culture, automate their processes and workflows, and use analytics to measure and improve their performance. &#13;
&#13;

&#13;
There are several factors hindering momentum and holding back organizations from fully realizing their digital transformation efforts. Many companies, for example, lack a clear focus on specific outcomes, along with securing widespread buy-in toward a shared goal, both of which are vital to successful digital transformation. Other challenges include:&#13;
&#13;
• Data silos&#13;
• Lack of coordination across business units&#13;
• Lack of proper technical experience&#13;
• Lack of integrated planning and execution&#13;

&#13;
The red-ocean strategy is based on the assumption that the market is fixed and defined by existing industry structures. In this scenario, companies compete fiercely for a limited share of the market. They try to gain an edge over their rivals by improving their products or services, lowering their costs, or increasing their marketing efforts. However, this often leads to a tight competition where profits are reduced and growth is limited. The red-ocean strategy is a zero-sum game where one company's gain is another company's loss.&#13;
&#13;
Blue-ocean strategy is based on the idea that the market is fluid and can be shaped by innovative actions. In this scenario, companies create new demand and new markets by offering something unique and valuable to customers. They do not follow the existing rules of the industry but rather redefine them or create new ones. They focus on creating value innovation, which means delivering superior value to customers while reducing costs. The blue-ocean strategy is a positive-sum game where everyone can benefit from the creation of new wealth.&#13;
&#13;
Blue oceans are the untapped opportunities that lie beyond the current boundaries of the industry. They are the result of breaking away from the competition and creating new values for customers. Blue oceans are characterized by:&#13;
&#13;
- Expanding the value proposition of the industry&#13;
- Aligning with external trends and forces&#13;
- Enhancing the price-performance trade-off of the industry&#13;
- Serving a broader range of customers&#13;
- Making competitors irrelevant&#13;
- Having a distinctive position in the market&#13;

Businesses need to evaluate their businesses as a whole and recognize the improvements in user experience, business processes, and workflow.&#13;
&#13;
In order to maximize the ROI of your digital transformation strategy, companies need to:&#13;
• set clear goals and objectives, &#13;
• involve all relevant stakeholders in the planning and execution, &#13;
• regularly track and measure the progress to ensure it is on track to meet its goal&#13;
• leverage data and analytics to optimize the project and make informed decisions about its direction, &#13;
• and create your ROI model ahead of time &#13;
&#13;
Worldwide spending on the technologies and services that enable the digital transformation of business practices, products, and organizations is forecast to reach $2.3 trillion in 2023, according to a new update to the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Semiannual Digital Transformation Spending Guide.&#13;

&#13;
Based on Accenture research, most have launched pilots to validate the potential of harnessing data and advanced analytics to improve their operations, and the most advanced have charted roadmaps to adaptive operations.&#13;
&#13;
However, there is still uncertainty around existing manufacturing systems architecture, emerging &#13;
technology and their ability to support these roadmaps and the deployment at scale of the related use cases.&#13;
&#13;
Use cases such as predictive maintenance or vision-based in-line inspection are relatively well understood. &#13;
&#13;
Software providers ranging from specialized start-ups to large, established software vendors sell specific niche solutions for such use cases. However, as manufacturers strive to progress further and faster toward end-to-end adaptive operations, they face common challenges:&#13;
&#13;
1. The siloed nature of traditional manufacturing architectures doesn’t support the tackling of the &#13;
highest value use cases, which often require reaching beyond individual assets or lines and beyond one single function, like maintenance or quality.&#13;
&#13;
2. The related solutions require the handling of vast amounts of data, which often exceeds the specs for existing architectures.]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 22 Nov 2022 08:15:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Post 632</title><link>https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:share:7050007879465996288</link><description>&lt;![CDATA[🎯Disruptive technologies are often the triggers for change, and companies that embrace them are propelled forward with a significant advantage over those that don’t.

With such successes, the demand for even more advanced AI-driven experiences is growing, such as smart products and environments that can work autonomously, interact with users in a natural way and adapt to different circumstances effortlessly. To keep up with these rising expectations, new approaches to the design of AI systems must be considered. &#13;
&#13;
The human brain is a remarkable source of inspiration for AI research, due to its extraordinary capacity for learning and computation with minimal energy consumption. Furthermore, it requires only a few examples in order to learn new patterns, in contrast to the processors currently used by AI systems, which require much more energy.&#13;
&#13;
𝗡𝗲𝘂𝗿𝗼𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗽𝗵𝗶𝗰 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 is a revolutionary form of AI which involves the use of hardware-accelerated computing to imitate the properties of biological brains. This technology has been designed to be responsive, enabling it to swiftly recognize and evade predators. It is also well-suited for the production of smart products which are adaptable and efficient, which is why it is becoming increasingly popular in the next wave of technology. Neuromorphic architectures differ from traditional processors in many ways, as they are designed to emulate neural systems.&#13;
&#13;
Neuromorphic technologies can provide solutions to various business issues that necessitate the utilization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the edge. Examples include the implementation of responsive voice control in vehicles, full-body gesture recognition for touchless interfaces, and the addition of onboard intelligence for assistive robotics.&#13;

&#13;
Business transformation is not just about changing processes, systems or structures. It is also about changing mindsets, behaviours and culture. A process point of view is a way of thinking that focuses on how work gets done in an organization, rather than on who does it or what tools are used. It involves identifying, analyzing, designing, and managing the core processes that deliver value to customers and stakeholders. &#13;
&#13;
A process point of view can help you:&#13;
&#13;
• Align your processes with your vision, mission, and strategy&#13;
• Identify and eliminate waste, inefficiencies, and redundancies&#13;
• Improve customer satisfaction and loyalty&#13;
• Enhance collaboration and communication across functions and departments&#13;
• Foster a culture of continuous improvement and innovation&#13;
• Increase agility and adaptability to changing market conditions&#13;
&#13;
If organizations adopt a process point of view, they can transform from a collection of silos to a network of interrelated and interdependent processes that work together to achieve a common purpose. Organizations can also leverage the power of process modelling, simulation, automation, and optimization to streamline their workflows and optimize their performance.&#13;
&#13;

But this growth has a high price tag. Automation will improve labour and productivity, but it could also replace up to 800 million jobs by then—almost 30% of workers around the world.&#13;
&#13;
By 2030, the jobs that require physical and basic cognitive skills will drop significantly, such as factory work, customer support, or data processing. This is a positive development for young people—getting rid of boring or repetitive work, allows more time to focus on complex problem-solving. Machines can’t compete with human skills such as compassion, creativity, negotiation, and critical thinking.&#13;
&#13;
AI and automation will also generate new jobs that we can’t foresee yet. Just like farming jobs have gradually been replaced with new alternatives over time, the rapid advancement of technology is also a new opportunity for the next generation.&#13;

&#13;
Artificial intelligence (AI) is reimagining the business world, boosting innovation and productivity, and helping organizations think bigger. Organizations can use AI to improve their products, processes and decision-making. Using the technology available today, organizations should be able to achieve organizational agility powered by AI.&#13;
&#13;
The impact of artificial intelligence is being felt across all industries. There are multiple examples of implementing AI in the supply chain, transportation, education, operations, marketing, and almost every industry that’s moving toward digitalization and switching from manual activities to technology-assisted ones. With the help of AI, companies are better equipped to fight disasters using AI decision-making algorithms, detect anomalies and predict future behaviour. AI enhances automation and reduces the human-intensive labour and tediousness involved in forecasting and prediction analysis.&#13;
&#13;
Some experts say the evolution or maturity of artificial intelligence can be divided into three stages: The first is assisted intelligence, where humans get insights from data and take action based on it. It is pure data-driven decision-making. The second stage is augmented intelligence, which takes the data processing a bit further.&#13;
&#13;
In the coming years, AI will probably reach the third stage, the point of full automation. All processes and activities will be completely digitized and automated through workflows, and machines, bots and systems will act directly upon intelligence derived from them.&#13;

Strategic shifts occur precisely when long-held assumptions about a sector are questioned. And you'll have to make those modifications rapidly. Thinking of strategy as a long-term commitment can blind you to the need for it. Strategy is about the fundamentals of how the business operates, not the long or short term: the sources of value creation, the drivers of the cost to deliver it, and the basis of competition.&#13;
&#13;
To grasp strategy, we must increase the depth of our thinking rather than the length of its time horizon. Far from being about what we will do in the future, strategy is about what we will do now to mould the future to our benefit.&#13;

However, there is now a 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗿𝗱 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: 𝗟𝗼𝘄-𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗲/𝗻𝗼-𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 enable organisations to build custom systems without hiring teams of developers or settling for close enough software for administrative tools, workflow or case management systems etc. &#13;
&#13;
Managers must understand how they work and what they are good for in order to make proper use of them: small business transactions, small-scale automation, analytics, and website development are all good use cases.&#13;
&#13;
There are also management issues to consider: the proliferation of applications created by "citizen developers" can lead to a shadow IT problem in which only one user understands how the system works. Department managers should be encouraged to facilitate Low-Code/No-Code development and educated on how the technology works, what tools are supported by the organisation, and the desired relationship between citizen developers and the IT organisation.&#13;
&#13;
These applications do not achieve these benefits by magic; rather, they delegate development to users rather than professional system developers. Users can usually design and implement their individual or departmental systems in a few hours using point-and-click or pull-down menu interfaces.&#13;
&#13;
𝗥𝗼𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 (𝗥𝗣𝗔), for example, is one of the fastest-growing LC/NC system categories. It allows users to design automated workflows that can reach multiple information systems by using rules for simple decision-making. This is ideal for automating administrative processes in the back office.&#13;
&#13;
Low-code workflow or 𝗰𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺𝘀 (a modern take on traditional business process management tools); virtual assistants or chatbot tools; and function-specific marketing tools are other examples of LC/NC tools.&#13;

Manufacturing leaders now have a clearer understanding of Industry 4.0 principles. Based on Accenture research, most have launched pilots to validate the potential of using data and advanced analytics to improve operations. &#13;
&#13;
However, challenges remain around manufacturing systems architecture, emerging technology, and their ability to support deployment at scale.&#13;
&#13;
Manufacturers face two common challenges: &#13;
1. traditional siloed architectures that don't support tackling high-value use cases and &#13;
2. handling vast amounts of data that often exceed existing specs. &#13;
&#13;
To overcome these limitations, manufacturing CIOs are investing in data lakes to collect all manufacturing data into one repository. &#13;
&#13;
However, the approach falls short of providing structured information and tools to enhance end-to-end operations.&#13;
&#13;
The concept of digital twins is gaining attention from manufacturing leaders because it can contextualize data from multiple sources and provide a 'one-stop-shop' for various use cases, such as simulation and predictive/adaptive intelligence at scale. &#13;
&#13;

&#13;
RPA is a form of business process automation where software robots are used to carry out repetitive and rules-based tasks. RPA can be used to automate a wide range of tasks, including data entry, data mining, and process monitoring.&#13;
&#13;
RPA is becoming increasingly popular as businesses look for ways to automate low-value tasks and free up employees to focus on more strategic work. RPA software is typically easy to use and can be deployed quickly, making it a cost-effective solution for many organizations.&#13;
&#13;
When considering RPA, it is important to understand the capabilities of the software and how it can be used to benefit your business. This introduction will provide an overview of RPA, its key features, and common use cases.&#13;
&#13;
What are the key features of RPA?&#13;
&#13;
RPA software typically includes the following features:&#13;
&#13;
- A user interface that allows users to configure the software to carry out specific tasks&#13;
- A set of tools for developing and testing automation scripts&#13;
- The ability to integrate with existing business applications&#13;
- A library of pre-built automation scripts&#13;
&#13;
What are the benefits of RPA?&#13;
&#13;
RPA can provide a number of benefits for businesses, including:&#13;
&#13;
- Increased efficiency: RPA can be used to automate tasks that are currently being carried out manually, such as data entry and process monitoring. This can help to improve efficiency and free up employees to focus on other tasks.&#13;
&#13;
- Reduced costs: RPA can help to reduce the cost of business processes by eliminating the need for manual labor.&#13;
&#13;
- Improved compliance: RPA can be used to automate compliance-related tasks, such as auditing and report generation. This can help to improve an organization's compliance posture.&#13;
&#13;
- Greater agility: RPA can help businesses to quickly adapt to changes in business processes. For example, if a new regulation is introduced, RPA can be used to automatically update the relevant business processes.&#13;
&#13;
What are the common use cases for RPA?&#13;
&#13;
RPA can be used to automate a wide range of tasks. Some common use cases for RPA include:&#13;
&#13;
- Data entry: RPA can be used to automatically populate data fields in business applications.&#13;
&#13;
- Data mining: RPA can be used to extract data from multiple sources and compile it into a single format.&#13;
&#13;
- Process monitoring: RPA can be used to monitor business processes and identify areas of improvement.&#13;
&#13;
- Report generation: RPA can be used to generate reports based on data from multiple sources.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
This problem is the lack of an effective “method” — a systematic or established procedure to undertake something, step by step. But methods can be learned. A 6-step method developed by Dr Graham Kenny include:&#13;
&#13;
1. recognize your dependencies, i.e. your key stakeholders&#13;
2.  identify your “target customer” &#13;
3. define what your organization wants from each key stakeholder group for your organization to prosper&#13;
4. identify what these stakeholder groups want from you&#13;
5. Strategy design, involves deciding what your organization’s positions will be on the identified strategic factors for each key stakeholder group&#13;
6. continuous improvement&#13;

The findings are based on data from more than a thousand companies, case studies, and interviews. On average, it took 22 months before companies began to see measurable results from the digital transformation process. (http://ow.ly/6aag50LpRi2)&#13;
&#13;
If you’re purchasing pricey software and systems for digital transformation, it is recommended to monitor how you’re capturing digital value with a dashboard:&#13;
&#13;
– Value from operations. (Implementing new platforms). “Is your cost of operations going down? Do you have more operational efficiency? Is your speed to market faster?” &#13;
&#13;
– Value from customers. (cross-selling, customer stickiness, and new offerings) “Are you increasing your revenue from customers? Are you able to cross-sell better?”&#13;
&#13;
– Value from your ecosystem. Bringing in partners and products and services from outside. “This is where you start to track things like revenues from partnering and start taking stock of what kind of data you see from the ecosystem.”&#13;
&#13;
Although all are important, when taking a look at each of the values individually, the value from customers contributed the most to revenue growth and profitability.&#13;

However, the scope of a CFO’s duties has increased dramatically in recent years. About 𝟰𝟭% 𝗼𝗳 𝗖𝗙𝗢𝘀 spend most of their time on non-finance-related activities, fueling data-driven decisions across the business. &#13;
&#13;
Thanks to technological advances, CFOs can now access massive amounts of data on their organization’s operational and financial performance. Armed with this data, CFOs can help predict headwinds, forecast performance, and make informed decisions across departments. &#13;
&#13;
CFOs see their most significant contributions in the areas of performance management and strategic leadership, while others still consider the CFO’s value to be derived primarily from traditional finance and cost/productivity management.&#13;
&#13;
How can CFOs demonstrate their increased responsibility to leaders outside of the finance realm? As per McKinsey, CFOs can demonstrate their expanded role, thus closing the gap, in three main ways:&#13;
&#13;
1. Actively head up transformations&#13;
2. Lead the charge towards digitization and automation&#13;
3. Develop talent and capabilities across the organization&#13;

&#13;
Innovation is relevant only if it creates value for customers — and&#13;
therefore for the firm. Thus creating “new things” is neither necessary nor sufficient for business innovation.  Customers are the ones who decide the worth of an innovation by voting with their wallets. It makes no difference how innovative a company thinks it is. What matters is whether customers will pay.&#13;
&#13;
💡 Successful business innovation requires the careful consideration of all aspects of a business. A great product with a lousy distribution channel will fail just as spectacularly as a terrific new technology that lacks a valuable end-user application. Thus, when innovating, a company must consider all dimensions of its business system.&#13;
&#13;
Based on discussions with managers leading innovation efforts at various large companies and a comprehensive survey of the academic literature on the topic, the authors of the study, validated and applied a new framework called the “innovation radar.” This tool presents and relates all of the dimensions through which a firm can look for opportunities to innovate. &#13;
&#13;
🎯 Much like a map, the innovation radar consists of four key dimensions that serve as business anchors: (1) the offerings a company creates, (2) the customers it serves, (3) the processes it employs and (4) the points of presence it uses to take its offerings to market. Between these four anchors, eight other dimensions of the business system are embedded that can serve as avenues of pursuit. Thus, the innovation radar contains a total of 12 key dimensions:&#13;
&#13;
1. Offering&#13;
2. Platform&#13;
3. Solutions&#13;
4. Customers&#13;
5. Customer Experience&#13;
6. Value Capture&#13;
7. Process&#13;
8. Organization&#13;
9. Supply Chain&#13;
10. Presence&#13;
11. Networking&#13;
12. Brand&#13;

&#13;
The process of transformation, from initiation to stabilization, entails various changes that affect the human aspect. It’s understandable that people often experience feelings of uncertainty and fear, which can sometimes create barriers in the execution process. This resistance may lead to suboptimal solution development, time delays, cost overruns, and other unwanted outcomes, which can, in turn, harm the overall transformation journey. This leads to the conclusion that poorly managed changes become a major reason for most of the digital transformations to fail- 𝗮𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱 𝟳𝟬% 𝗼𝗳 𝗶𝘁 (as per McKinsey &amp; Company).&#13;

However, as generative AI continues to develop and mature, it has the potential to open wholly new frontiers in creativity and innovation. It has already expanded the possibilities of what AI overall can achieve.&#13;
&#13;
Generative AI could have an impact on most business functions; however, a few stand out when measured by the technology’s impact as a share of functional cost. McKinsey's analysis of 16 business functions identified just four—customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering, and research and development—that could account for approximately 75 percent of the total annual value from generative AI use cases.&#13;

&#13;
Measure what matters!&#13;
&#13;
Only 4% of organizations have no digital initiative at all, which signals a shift from digital as an option to digital as a mainstream platform. And yet, Gartner survey found that almost half of CEOs had no metrics for digital business transformation. Boards of directors typically look for benefits, costs and risks of following a digital transformation plan — or of not doing anything at all.&#13;
&#13;
When it comes to creating digital KPIs, keep it simple. "Choose KPIs that you can measure easily. Don’t try to build a KPI hierarchy. Select just 5 to 9 metrics to track, report and act on. The value of a metric lies in its ability to influence business decision making.” KPIs need to be industry-specific and then organization-specific to be meaningful and useful. To create a digital KPI, ask these five key questions:&#13;
&#13;
1. What is being measured? An example might be the percentage of customer interactions that are virtual/digital.&#13;
2. Where are we today?&#13;
3. What is our target goal?&#13;
4. What is our desired business outcome/benefit (for example, 50% better customer outcomes and 20% lower cost)?&#13;
5. What is our balance point?&#13;
&#13;
A “balance point” describes the reasons why an enterprise shouldn’t overdigitalize. &#13;

⚡What was discovered by Deloitte, is that a process is linear and intuitive, but also tedious and often fraught with pitfalls. Fortunately, the process seems adaptable for manufacturers of all sizes, and risks can be partially mitigated by planning and prioritizing the investments.&#13;
&#13;
When probed about the business reasons influencing smart factories, the research respondents identified concrete business outcomes. Specifically, they selected:&#13;
1. improved production capacity, &#13;
2. increased throughput, &#13;
3. greater visibility into asset performance and &#13;
4. enhanced product/part quality &#13;
   &#13;
   as the key reason to start or expand initiatives. So a business case with a pointed outcome is a must-have.&#13;
&#13;
However, the leaders in the market who have gone through this process had multiple approaches and not just one tried-and-true path. Multiple approaches allowed them to test more options; if one approach flops, another will work and give greater results.&#13;
Starting small with POC and scaling them can work in the smart factory domain. The same survey suggests that leaders had 50 to 70 small use cases running across the different plants simultaneously.&#13;

It requires a clear vision, a strategic roadmap and a culture of innovation.&#13;
&#13;
The article by Harvard Business Review it is explained how to start with a digital maturity model that assesses your current state identifies your gaps and opportunities and defines your desired outcomes. It also provides a framework for prioritizing and executing your digital initiatives based on their impact and feasibility.&#13;
&#13;
Digital maturity is the degree to which an organization can leverage digital technologies to create value for its customers, employees, and stakeholders. It is not only about having the latest tools and platforms, but also about having the right mindset, culture, and capabilities to adapt and innovate in a fast-changing environment.&#13;
&#13;
One of the best models that can help organizations assess their digital maturity has been developed by Digitopia (and provided by Pyron Technology), a platform that measures and benchmarks digital maturity as the ultimate digital transformation key performance indicator (KPI). Digitopia uses a comprehensive framework that covers six dimensions: 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝘆, 𝗰𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲, 𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀, 𝗼𝗿𝗴𝗮𝗻𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 &amp; 𝗰𝘂𝗹𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲, 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝘆 &amp; 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗶𝗻𝗻𝗼𝘃𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻.&#13;

It’s a valuable business asset when used with care and in-depth understanding. However, it’s important to remember that predictive analytics is not a silver bullet solution and should be used in conjunction with other business strategies to achieve optimal results. &#13;
&#13;
In addition, businesses should be aware of common pitfalls when using predictive analytics such as over-reliance on data, high up-front costs, incorrect analytics owing to inadequate data, or the requirement for a skilled workforce. By understanding these challenges and using predictive analytics responsibly, businesses can gain valuable insights into their operations and make data-driven decisions that drive growth and success. &#13;
&#13;
Nevertheless, predictive analytics has become a significant aspect for most businesses in order to grow and survive in this highly competitive market. It is considered to be most beneficial when combined with business intelligence to obtain optimum results.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Businesses worldwide recognize the importance of quick and effective change to stay current and adaptable, as well as responsible. One crucial aspect of this transformation is the evolution of their manufacturing operations. Three burning platforms are driving them toward the next digital frontier:&#13;
&#13;
1️⃣ Workforce digital upskilling/reskilling. &#13;
2️⃣ Software redefines physical products. &#13;
3️⃣ The sustainability imperative depends on digital.&#13;
&#13;
These three advancements represent the next digital frontier for most manufacturers. They present major challenges for manufacturers to stay relevant to customers and employees, maintain resilience, and act responsibly.&#13;
&#13;
🎯The technologies are available and have proven their worth and both the need and the benefits of digital manufacturing are obvious. Companies that intelligently connect technology and manage the change it brings wisely can go beyond the efficiency and effectiveness scenarios that Industry 4.0 provides.&#13;

&#13;
Do you want to create a company business model that can thrive in the future? If so, you need to learn how to design and innovate your business model based on different scenarios. &#13;
&#13;
In today’s dynamic and uncertain environment, business models need to be constantly updated and adapted to changing conditions. To design effective business models for the future, we need to enhance our knowledge of the external factors that influence them. These include market forces, industry forces, key trends, and macroeconomic forces. &#13;
&#13;
However, predicting the future is not easy, as there are many complexities, uncertainties, and potential disruptions that may affect the business environment. Therefore, we need to develop multiple scenarios based on different assumptions about how these factors will evolve. These scenarios will help us identify the possible opportunities and challenges for our business models and create various options or prototypes to test and evaluate. Business model scenarios also play a critical role in forecasting, as they help us visualize and communicate the future more clearly. Depending on our own criteria (e.g., an acceptable level of risk, growth potential sought, etc.), we can then select the most suitable option for our business model innovation (BMI).&#13;
&#13;
BMI is a key driver of firm performance and competitiveness. According to a recent study by the OECD, firms that introduced product or business process innovations between 2016 and 2018 had higher productivity growth than non-innovators. Another study found that the business model accounts for 5.1% of a firm’s return on investment, after controlling for other factors. Moreover, BMI can help firms cope with environmental and social challenges, such as climate change, resource scarcity, and social inclusion. Therefore, understanding and managing BMI processes is essential for firms to succeed in the long term.&#13;
&#13;
If you want to learn more about how to use business model scenarios for your BMI, DM me. &#13;

They are amazed by how well these systems can convey complex thoughts in clear language. However, they also know that these systems mainly learn from internet-based data and can’t answer queries or requests about confidential content or knowledge.&#13;
&#13;
Using a company’s exclusive knowledge is essential for its ability to compete and innovate, especially in today’s uncertain environment. Organizational Innovation is driven by effective and agile creation, management, application, recombination, and deployment of knowledge assets and know-how. However, knowledge within organizations is typically produced and captured across various sources and forms, such as individual minds, processes, policies, reports, operational transactions, discussion boards, and online chats and meetings. As such, a company’s comprehensive knowledge is often overlooked and hard to organize and deploy where needed effectively or efficiently.&#13;

&#13;
In addition to external trading partners, suppliers, customers, third-party data service providers, and all of their various technologies, a digital ecosystem also includes internal solutions, apps, and systems.&#13;
&#13;
As a dynamic, interconnected network, the digital ecosystem requires dependable communication between customers and business partners. When a digital ecosystem is connected, businesses can use both new and old technology to flourish continuously. These technologies can be surrounded by automated procedures.&#13;
&#13;
By merging B2B, application, and data linkages to the whole business network, an integrated digital ecosystem enables enterprises to construct end-to-end business flows from the "outside-in."&#13;
&#13;
⚡Enterprises may run business activities more effectively and in a fully manageable way thanks to digital ecosystems. Here are the top three ways that ecosystems with digital integration create value.&#13;
&#13;
1. 𝘊𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘵𝘦 𝘕𝘦𝘸 𝘚𝘰𝘶𝘳𝘤𝘦𝘴 𝘰𝘧 𝘙𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘯𝘶𝘦&#13;
Through consolidated ecosystem integration, which enables businesses to collect and analyse the vast amounts of data moving through their company and use it to develop new products and services, digital ecosystems help businesses generate new revenue streams. Such integration improves existing income-generating procedures while also developing value-added services for emerging revenue streams.&#13;
&#13;
2. 𝘓𝘰𝘸𝘦𝘳 𝘊𝘰𝘴𝘵𝘴 𝘛𝘩𝘳𝘰𝘶𝘨𝘩 𝘐𝘮𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘷𝘦𝘥 𝘉𝘶𝘴𝘪𝘯𝘦𝘴𝘴 𝘗𝘳𝘰𝘤𝘦𝘴𝘴𝘦𝘴&#13;
Companies that have embraced ecosystem integration platforms and digital transformation are also realising quantifiable cost benefits. End-to-end integration not only increases workflow effectiveness but also enhances working relationships with clients and partners and lowers operational expenses due to business-wide efficiency and automated data processing.&#13;
&#13;
3. 𝘐𝘯𝘤𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘦 𝘚𝘱𝘦𝘦𝘥 𝘰𝘧 𝘛𝘦𝘤𝘩𝘯𝘰𝘭𝘰𝘨𝘺 𝘈𝘥𝘰𝘱𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯&#13;
A plan for ecosystem integration helps businesses to completely use new technologies in previously challenging ways. Instead of relying on antiquated legacy software that cannot keep up with the pace of the enterprise today, businesses may now take use of contemporary cloud services and SaaS solutions.&#13;

In fact, it could be a highly destructive development, with AI tools potentially generating a limitless amount of complex threats at a rapid pace. But on the other hand, AI also allows for more efficient and effective real-time defences to be implemented, which several cybersecurity providers are already taking advantage of. &#13;

Some fundamental transformation technologies have been around for well over a decade and almost every company has some form of digital strategy in place. Digital transformation is something like digital evolution for companies, and similar to biological evolution, there is no end. There is not, and in fact cannot be, a final destination for digital transformation, which is why staying on top of transformation trends must remain a priority among the C-suite.&#13;
&#13;
Business decision-makers still see digital transformation as a central component of their company’s growth strategy. About half of C-level executives develop digital strategies to differentiate themselves from their competitors, while an additional 28% believe digital transformation projects are necessary to keep up with industry peers. &#13;

⚡Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) represent 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝟵𝟬% 𝗼𝗳 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗯𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 and more than half of employment worldwide. They play an acutely important role in the global economy — and they can play a role in responding to the climate crisis, too.&#13;
&#13;
Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) can help SMEs reduce waste, optimize operations and monitor processes more effectively.&#13;
&#13;
Estimates show that the average price of IoT sensors has declined over the last 2 decades — from $𝟭.𝟯𝟬 𝗶𝗻 𝟮𝟬𝟬𝟰 𝘁𝗼 $𝟬.𝟯𝟴 𝗶𝗻 𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟬. This price drop has been fuelled by an increased number of suppliers, more optimized and efficient technology and falling cost of connection, storage and processing. As IoT technologies become more accessible, SMEs are in better positions to embrace simple yet proven IoT technology applications that will make their businesses more profitable and sustainable.&#13;

As a forward-thinking CEO, the onus is on you to navigate this transformation with strategy and precision. &#13;
&#13;
𝗔𝗿𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗱𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝘁𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗽𝘀 𝘁𝗼𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗱 𝗮 𝗱𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗮𝗴𝗶𝗹𝗲 𝗳𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗽𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗲?&#13;
&#13;
Smart factory solutions offer numerous pathways that need to be defined, planned, and executed at a pace suitable to the organization. &#13;
&#13;
📌 Manufacturers can start their journey to a smart factory by following the steps below:&#13;
&#13;
1. Think big, start small, and scale fast.&#13;
&#13;
2. Start small and scale to unlock value but stay grounded in the specific needs of the factory.&#13;
&#13;
3. Don't just begin and end with the technologies.&#13;
&#13;
4. Think outside the four walls.&#13;
&#13;
Investing in a smart factory capability can enable manufacturers to differentiate themselves and function more effectively and efficiently in an ever-more complex and rapidly shifting ecosystem. &#13;
&#13;
The smart factory is an evolving solution that taps into multiple features such as agility, connectedness, and transparency. &#13;
&#13;
It calls for creative thinking, and investing in it can help manufacturers create exponential value-creation opportunities.&#13;

This also reminded me on the post by Jeroen Kraaijenbrink few days back.&#13;
&#13;
Change is not a quick or easy thing. It takes time and can hurt. But you can cope better if you know what to expect and how to react. Also,c hange is not just a rational choice or a simple action. Change means giving up something and feeling many emotions. You can’t skip these emotions, but you can learn from them.&#13;
&#13;
Change is like a roller coaster. It has ups and downs, but it follows a pattern.  You start with loss and denial. You feel shocked, angry, and anxious. Then you enter a transition period. You realize that change is real and unavoidable. You feel confused, frustrated, and depressed. At the end, you reach acceptance and hope. You start to see the benefits of change and get creative. You feel impatient, optimistic, and energized. &#13;
&#13;
If you know what to expect and how to act, you can make change work for you and your employees.&#13;
&#13;
What are your thoughts and experience in change management?&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Porter’s Five Forces model focuses on developing a strategic framework that starts with analyzing the external environment. It provides insight into the intensity of competition, potential profitability, and attractiveness of an industry by focusing on the industry and market. However, it is limited to existing value propositions and profit opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
On the other hand, the Blue Ocean Strategy is an approach to innovate value and create new market space by tapping into unsatisfied consumer demand and finding uncontested market space. As a result, competition becomes irrelevant because the rules of the game are yet to be set.&#13;
&#13;
It's important to point out that Porter’s Five Forces model is a valuable tool for analyzing existing markets while the Blue Ocean Strategy is a powerful tool for creating new markets.&#13;

A recent McKinsey &amp; Company report highlights that 𝟳𝟬% 𝗼𝗳 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗲𝗳𝗳𝗼𝗿𝘁𝘀 𝗳𝗮𝗶𝗹 due to the lack of employee engagement and support. Focusing on people is key to successful change management. &#13;
&#13;
McKinsey provided a holistic perspective which suggests that four basic conditions are necessary before employees will change their behaviour: &#13;
1. 𝗮 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆, because employees must see the point of the change and agree with it; &#13;
2. 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴, because they must also see the CEO and colleagues they admire behaving in a new way; &#13;
3. 𝗿𝗲𝗶𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗺𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗶𝘀𝗺𝘀, because systems, processes, and incentives must be in line with the new behaviour; and&#13;
4. 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴, because employees must have the skills required to make the desired changes.&#13;
&#13;
Effective change management helps organizations navigate the transition and achieve desired outcomes by engaging and empowering employees. Embracing change with a people-focused approach can lead to increased productivity, improved employee morale, and overall success.&#13;

Industry 4.0 collects and analyses data using sensor technologies, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.&#13;
The advantages are reduced production downtime, improved product quality, and proactive maintenance.&#13;
&#13;
However, significant constraints like as legacy operations and a failure to adequately engage frontline workers in operational redesign frequently stymie such large-scale reform.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Sensor networks are the backbone for generating feedback loops to uncover hidden factories, the poorly understood processes and workarounds that drive up production costs and slow systems down.&#13;
&#13;
However, as firms implement Industry 4.0, they frequently wind up acquiring data at a much faster rate than it can be used.&#13;
&#13;
Despite investments in new technologies and business process innovations, the most significant hurdles to Industry 4.0 transformation are operational practices and old mindsets that keep employees anchored to familiar work patterns.&#13;
&#13;
One of the primary issues is a 𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗼𝗳 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗿𝗱𝗶𝘀𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻. The traditional working modes have too many variations, making it challenging to identify the business processes and workflows that will decrease company risk and boost productivity.&#13;
&#13;
𝗚𝗵𝗼𝘀𝘁𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗼𝗹𝗱 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗲𝘀. When new technologies and ways of working create a challenge, some people will revert to the status quo. When pushed under duress, employees will resort to the old system until they gain confidence in the new technology. Value does not become apparent until the old ways of doing things are phased out.&#13;
&#13;
𝗜𝗻𝘀𝘂𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻. Companies that invest in cutting-edge sensors and software frequently underestimate the level of worker training required to use those tools to improve maintenance and diagnostics. Capital-intensive systems necessitate additional preparation; the level of preparation and training should be proportional to the machinery's complexity.&#13;

They can represent anything from a car to a city, and they are constantly updated with real-time data and feedback loops to ensure they match the reality. This enables manufacturers to use them and learn as if they are experimenting in the real world.&#13;
&#13;
Manufacturers use digital twins for various purposes, but the most common ones are related to improving the production process or sustainability. Digital twins for production can enhance manufacturing by reducing costs and increasing efficiency. These often have positive and unnoticed consequences. The more efficient operations tend to use less energy and water, produce less waste and emissions, and have a smaller environmental impact. Likewise, digital twins for sustainability can also lead to cost reductions and efficiency improvements, even if that is not their main objective.&#13;
&#13;
It is a missed opportunity for manufacturers to view digital twins for production and digital twins for sustainability as separate entities. This creates an incomplete model that does not capture all aspects of production. &#13;
&#13;
As digital twins evolve, manufacturers should integrate production and sustainability metrics into a single digital twin to reap the full benefits of the model.&#13;

&#13;
Data is the lifeblood of any modern organization. But as data grows in volume, variety, and velocity, it becomes harder to manage and use effectively. Traditional data architectures, such as data warehouses and data lakes, are struggling to keep up with the demands of today’s data-driven businesses.&#13;
&#13;
Data mesh is a way of making data easier to manage and use for everyone in the business. It lets different teams and departments have their own data and take care of it themselves. It also lets them share their data with others and work together to create value from data. It empowers data producers and consumers to collaborate and co-create value from data, while ensuring data quality, governance, and security.&#13;
&#13;
Data mesh is not just a technical solution, but a cultural shift in how we think about and work with data. It requires a new mindset of treating data as a product, not a project. It also requires a new set of skills and tools to enable data autonomy and interoperability.&#13;
&#13;
If you want to learn more about data mesh and how it can help you unlock the full potential of your data, I invite you to read this insightful article from McKinsey: https://lnkd.in/dqGSwwj3&#13;

&#13;
This is almost always the case when discussing the strategy with C-level executives. A great article by Dr Graham Kenny published in HBR has covered a 6 step approach to resolving this matter and defining the proper company strategy.&#13;
&#13;
1. Recognize your dependencies i.e. key stakeholders&#13;
2. Identify and describe your target customer (persona)&#13;
3. Understand and work on what the company wants from each of the key stakeholders in order to prosper&#13;
4. What these stakeholders want from the company&#13;
5. Design the strategy by deciding what the company's position will be on strategic factors for each stakeholder group&#13;
6. Continuous improvement - iterate and learn from your mistakes, improve &#13;

&#13;
Perhaps your company needs to cut costs, increase margins, or reinvest. Or perhaps your company is still trying to expand. Maybe it's time for a pivot — to reinvent the business model. Some people may need to do all of these things at once.&#13;
&#13;
Business leaders and technologists should evaluate the potential impact of these trends on their specific strategies, as each one may represent a risk or an opportunity for your company.&#13;
&#13;
Gartner has created a list of trends that expect to impact enterprise strategies in the coming three years by enabling organizations to address four key priorities:&#13;
•	𝗢𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗶𝗻𝗴 resilience, operations or trust&#13;
•	𝗦𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 vertical solutions, product delivery or everywhere&#13;
•	𝗣𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 customer engagement, accelerated responses or opportunity&#13;
•	Pursuing 𝘀𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝘆 solutions&#13;
&#13;
Whether you need to optimise, scale, or pioneer — or figure out how to do so sustainably — analysing these trends will help you develop a technology roadmap that will have an impact on a variety of strategic goals, such as increasing revenue, accelerating digital, maximising value from data, or protecting and building your brand.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
That simple question often throws the CEOs of traditional companies into a panic. They believe that digital technologies and business models pose an existential threat to their way of doing business—and of course they’re right. But the pressure they feel often leads them to make big bet-the-farm moves—and that’s usually wrong.&#13;
&#13;
Just because a threat is huge doesn’t mean that a response has to be. To the contrary, companies would actually be much better off taking a more incremental approach to transformation over time. While they should always have a vision of where they want to go, they should work their way toward it by continually finding opportunities to digitize problematic processes in their core operations. When they tackle those projects, they’ll learn what metrics to use, which assumptions to revise, where they can introduce new business models, and who their new competitors might be. And as they absorb those lessons, their understanding of their competitive landscape—and the long-term goals they set for themselves—will inevitably change. &#13;
&#13;
💡There’s already a process for this kind of ongoing learning approach to strategy: discovery-driven planning (DDP). &#13;
&#13;
🎯DDP is somewhat like reverse engineering. When you use it in product development, you begin by imagining the offering you want to create and then figure out what you would need to change in order to get there. When you apply it to digital transformations, however, the focus is on reinventing the way you sell and deliver the products you already make as well as on identifying how to create and deliver new value through new digital capabilities.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
⚡What was discovered by Deloitte, is that a process is linear and intuitive, but also tedious and often fraught with pitfalls. Fortunately, the process seems adaptable for manufacturers of all sizes, and risks can be partially mitigated by planning and prioritizing the investments.&#13;
&#13;
When probed about the business reasons influencing smart factories, the research respondents identified concrete business outcomes. Specifically, they selected:&#13;
1. improved production capacity, &#13;
2. increased throughput, &#13;
3. greater visibility into asset performance and &#13;
4. enhanced product/part quality &#13;
   &#13;
as the key reason to start or expand initiatives. So, a business case with a pointed outcome is a must-have.&#13;
&#13;
However, the leaders in the market who have gone through this process had multiple approaches and not just one tried-and-true path. Multiple approaches allowed them to test more options; if one approach flops, another will work and give greater results.&#13;
&#13;
Starting small with POC and scaling them can work in the smart factory domain. The same survey suggests that leaders had 50 to 70 small use cases running across the different plants simultaneously.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
According to McKinsey &amp; Company's research, companies can rethink their response to cost increases. They must go beyond conventional commercial levers and take a more holistic approach, one that addresses opportunities to control costs and to reduce the impact of volatility across the organization’s full spectrum of activities. That perspective will encompass far-reaching changes to the way products are designed and manufactured, as well as to the structure of the end-to-end value chain.&#13;
&#13;
Business operations bear the brunt of cost increases because they are where the money is spent: on labour, energy, materials, and logistics services, for example. But operations also offer the opportunity to change a company’s exposure to those costs. And smart decisions on the way value chains are designed, built, and run can have a transformative impact on the organization’s cost base.&#13;
&#13;
Few of the levers mentioned in the research are new, but indicates that they are significantly underutilized today, for two principal reasons:&#13;
&#13;
1. making them work requires coordinated action across the entire organization. &#13;
&#13;
2. some of the most powerful responses to rising and volatile prices call for structural changes to supply chains, production footprints, and even entire business models—all of which fall beyond the remit of operational leaders at most companies. &#13;
&#13;
That’s why business operations need to be right at the top of the CEO agenda. &#13;
&#13;
Not surprisingly, digitally transforming the business and leveraging Industry 4.0 technologies is the next step towards holistic transformation and operations excellence.&#13;

&#13;
Automakers around the world are looking for ways to increase circularity in order to reduce waste and Scope 3 emissions, strengthen supply chain resilience, and generate new value as they transition to a low-carbon future. Many automakers have committed to programs to enhance circularity, including using more recycled materials and remanufactured components in production, and better managing the reclamation of materials from vehicles at the end of their useful lives.&#13;
&#13;
In the mobility sector, circularity means more than just recycling the parts from scrap vehicles. Full circularity includes adhering to principles of circular design (for example, reducing the need for materials, cutting waste, and increasing the potential for end-of-life reuse and recycling), increasing the amount of recycled content in production, and deploying business models that improve vehicle utilization—meaning, they are used more hours of the day. Because mobility represents a significant share of global emissions (about 30%), any comprehensive approach to mitigating climate change must substantially reshape the ways that vehicles are produced, used, and recycled. The sector is responsible for about 10% of the world’s material footprint, so circularity is also key to decoupling the need for transportation from material consumption.&#13;

Artificial intelligence (AI) is reimagining the business world, boosting innovation and productivity, and helping organizations think bigger. Organizations can use AI to improve their products, processes and decision-making. Using the technology available today, organizations should be able to achieve organizational agility powered by AI.&#13;
&#13;
The impact of artificial intelligence is being felt across all industries. There are multiple examples of implementing AI in the supply chain, transportation, education, operations, marketing, and almost every industry that’s moving toward digitalization and switching from manual activities to technology-assisted ones. With the help of AI, companies are better equipped to fight disasters using AI decision-making algorithms, detect anomalies and predict future behaviour. AI enhances automation and reduces the human-intensive labour and tediousness involved in forecasting and prediction analysis.&#13;
&#13;
Some experts say the evolution or maturity of artificial intelligence can be divided into three stages: The first is assisted intelligence, where humans get insights from data and take action based on it. It is pure data-driven decision-making. The second stage is augmented intelligence, which takes the data processing a bit further.&#13;
&#13;
In the coming years, AI will probably reach the third stage, the point of full automation. All processes and activities will be completely digitized and automated through workflows, and machines, bots and systems will act directly upon intelligence derived from them.&#13;

&#13;
Innovation may not put you at risk of sudden death, but it is anxiety-inducing nonetheless. It is more ambiguous than any other business activity, requiring bold bets in the face of uncertain outcomes and a willingness to persevere despite setbacks, criticism, and self-doubt. This is why most teams, in moments of honest self-reflection, will agree that fear can paralyze innovation. In fact, 𝟴𝟱 𝗽𝗲𝗿 𝗰𝗲𝗻𝘁 of executives recently polled by McKinsey &amp; Company agree that 𝗳𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝗵𝗼𝗹𝗱𝘀 𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗶𝗻𝗻𝗼𝘃𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗲𝗳𝗳𝗼𝗿𝘁𝘀 often or always in their organizations. Average or below-average innovators are three times more likely than innovation leaders to report this phenomenon. Yet 𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗲𝗻 𝗼𝗿𝗴𝗮𝗻𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 are doing nothing to allay these fears.&#13;
&#13;
It has been found that the culture and employee experience of innovation correlate highly with an organization’s overall success at innovating. At the same time, fear is a constant for almost all practitioners. However, there are big disparities in the nature and intensity of that fear, as well as in how companies temper its negative impact.&#13;
&#13;
Organizations wishing to build a thriving culture of innovation need to be systematic and intentional. The same research and client experience have shown that all high-performing innovators embrace to various degrees five dimensions of innovation culture:&#13;
1. Believe and value&#13;
2. Frame and champion&#13;
3. Signal and symbolize&#13;
4. Show and ritualize&#13;
5. Shield and empower&#13;
&#13;
By providing employees with psychological safety, an innovation-centric purpose, and explicit encouragement and rewards, management can help them find the courage to risk failure in pursuit of creative ambition. Only by addressing the fears that hold people back from experimenting can companies build a true innovation culture.&#13;

&#13;
CEOs should take a fresh take on objective-settings! 🚀&#13;
&#13;
Mid-sized company CEOs, strategic objective-setting can be a minefield. The traditional method often leaves us with an overflowing list of vague, difficult-to-measure objectives. Sound familiar?&#13;
&#13;
📌 Here's an insight many miss: Shift from Inside-Out to Outside-In thinking. &#13;
&#13;
Instead of starting with what your company wants to achieve, begin by asking what you want from each key stakeholder group.&#13;
&#13;
🔑 Three-Step Revamp:&#13;
&#13;
1. 𝗜𝗱𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗳𝘆 𝗮 𝗕𝗲𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗼𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗢𝘂𝘁𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗲: Before diving into objectives, understand what actions you desire from each stakeholder group. This anchors your objectives.&#13;
2. 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗢𝗿𝗴𝗮𝗻𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗢𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲𝘀: These are clear, and tangible, often beginning with "to increase" or "to decrease." It reflects the behavioural outcomes.&#13;
3. 𝗗𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗠𝗲𝗮𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀 (𝗞𝗣𝗜𝘀): Simplify measurements. There are only three symbols that matter: $ (financials), # (quantities), and % (percentages).&#13;
&#13;
For instance, instead of setting an objective to "improve member engagement," dive deeper. What behaviour do you seek? &#13;
&#13;
Maybe it's for members to "borrow more." Translate that to "increase loan revenue from existing and potential members." Then, measure revenue growth, the number of loans, and market share percentage.&#13;
&#13;
🔥 The Outcome? Clarity. You’ll have strategic objectives directly tied to stakeholders, guiding your decisions and ensuring alignment with measurable outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
CEOs, don't let your strategy exist in ambiguity. Identify who your key stakeholders are and clarify what you desire from them. With this approach, you not only have clarity but a more targeted, measurable strategy.&#13;
&#13;
Rethink your strategic journey. If you’re ready to shift from a hodgepodge list to clear, measurable objectives, let’s start a conversation. Strategic clarity is within your reach. &#13;

Companies leading with digital transformation are seeing ⚡𝗻𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗹𝘆 𝘁𝘄𝗶𝗰𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘂𝗲 𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘄𝘁𝗵 of those not so digitally inclined. But it depends on what part of the company is involved.&#13;
&#13;
That’s the word from a survey of 1,400 companies, released by Valoir Incorporated, which connects the dots between digital transformation and financial performance. Those at the high end of profit-margin growth often take advantage of technology to launch completely new business models with dramatically different cost structures than they had previously operated.&#13;
&#13;
Other factors driving growth are the ability to significantly automate manual internal processes to reduce costs, moving to cloud technologies, and implementing new customer service models such as multichannel self-service.&#13;
&#13;
Digital transformation progress varies by industry, the survey finds, with healthcare leading the way, followed by financial services, aerospace, and communications. The laggards are the public sector, utilities, and consumer goods.&#13;

&#13;
The GII 2022 tracks global innovation trends against the background of an ongoing pandemic, a slowing of productivity growth and other evolving challenges.&#13;
&#13;
The main findings this year are as follows:&#13;
1. Contrary to what historic evidence would suggest, science and innovation investments were thriving at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and boomed in 2021, but their continued resilience is uncertain for 2022 in the face of new challenges.&#13;
   &#13;
2. The indicators of technological progress in the fields of semiconductor speeds, electric battery prices, the cost of renewable energy (with the exception of wind) and drug approvals show a significant slowdown from long-term trends and even a decline in the case of drug approvals.&#13;
   &#13;
3. Technology adoption is progressing, with positive growth rates across technologies measured by the Global Innovation Tracker, in particular for electric vehicles. However, penetration rates are still medium to low, with the exception of mobile broadband, which reaches the vast majority of the global population.&#13;
   &#13;
4. Largely due to the short-term influences of the COVID-19 pandemic, the socioeconomic impact of innovation seems to be at a low point, with labour productivity and life expectancy experiencing a significant slowdown if not coming to a complete standstill, and in the case of carbon dioxide emissions, failing to show ongoing reductions in pollution.&#13;

Manufacturing is a core part of many businesses that need to transform rapidly and effectively to stay relevant, resilient and responsible in a changing world. The pandemic, software innovation and sustainability demands are three key drivers that push them to embrace the next digital frontier:&#13;
&#13;
1. Bringing AI to the shopflor.&#13;
2. Building Digital Twins of their products/services/factories/businesses.&#13;
3. The software enables new capabilities and value propositions for physical products.&#13;
4. Sustainability goals require digital solutions and data insights.&#13;
   &#13;
These three trends are shaping the future of manufacturing and challenging the current paradigms of how to deliver value to customers and employees. They offer new opportunities for manufacturers to go beyond the efficiency and effectiveness scenarios that Industry 4.0 provides.&#13;
&#13;
🎯The technologies are ready and proven, and the benefits of digital manufacturing are clear. The question is: are you ready to seize them? Companies that leverage technology smartly and manage the change it brings skillfully can gain a competitive edge in the next digital frontier. &#13;

As a result, they often make only ad hoc changes and investments in the digital arena, with ineffectual results. The challenge, to which most companies have yet to rise, is figuring out how to fully capture the different kinds of value that these technologies offer. Developing a strategy for digital transformation that fully leverages this value is also not easy. Without a comprehensive assessment of what digital technologies can offer, firms tend to assume that any application of modern digital technologies will lead to a digital transformation.&#13;
&#13;
Defined by Harvard Business Review there are four distinct tiers of digital transformation, each of which meets different strategic objectives and allows companies to maximize the value they capture from digital technologies:&#13;
&#13;
1. Tier One: Operational efficiencies&#13;
2. Tier Two: Advanced operational efficiencies&#13;
3. Tier Three: Data-driven services from value chains&#13;
4. Tier Four: Data-driven services from digital platforms&#13;
&#13;
To think properly about these four tiers of transformation, the first step is to recognize that modern digital technologies have two notable value drivers: data in its new expansive role, and emergent digital ecosystems.&#13;
&#13;
Data used to be episodic (generated by discrete events such as the shipment of a component from a supplier), but increasingly it is becoming interactive (generated continuously by sensors and the IoT to track information).  Two main kinds of digital ecosystems have emerged, neither of which existed before modern advances in data and digital connectivity. One kind is the production ecosystem, which encompasses digital linkages within value chains. By linking sensor and IoT data from cars to spare-part suppliers, warehouses, and service dealers, for example, car companies can offer predictive maintenance services. The other kind is the consumption ecosystem, which involves networks outside of a firm’s value chain. &#13;

RPA is the use of software robots that can mimic human actions and perform tasks across various systems without the need for integration or coding.&#13;
&#13;
Many organizations have great products that can solve their customers’ problems and make their lives better. But they are struggling to reach them and convince them to buy. They are spending too much time and money on manual, repetitive tasks that don’t add value to their business therefore they are losing customers to their competitors who are faster, cheaper and more reliable.&#13;
&#13;
Companies know they need to change their business model and operations to be more agile, efficient and secure. To achieve it they need to leverage digital technologies to transform their processes, customer relationships, sales and service. Usually, companies are not aware of where to start or how to do it. Overwhelmed by the complexity and cost of integrating different systems and applications, companies are reluctant due to the risks of errors, fraud and breaches that can damage their reputation and bottom line.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Whether this moment leads to a turn in the business cycle or to a continuation of recent inflationary trends, it is a time when companies can make the kind of pivot that strengthens their growth trajectory for the next several years. A research done by McKinsey &amp; Company indicates that the moves companies make now could account for half of the difference in total shareholder returns (TSR) between leading and lagging companies over the next business cycle. It’s therefore critical for leaders to get their next steps right.&#13;
&#13;
Companies head into this uncertainty with different degrees of readiness and health. Most fall into one of four camps:&#13;
&#13;
1. Some are poised to thrive. They enjoy relatively inelastic demand for high-margin products, find it relatively easy to attract and retain talent, and have blessedly simple supply chains. Financially, they have strong balance sheets, low leverage, and ample cash. For them, the strategic options are multiplying.&#13;
&#13;
2. Other companies are more constrained. Their varied challenges include greater susceptibility to a slowing economy, recent loss of market share to new entrants, thinner margins now being inflated away, labour challenges, and more complicated supply chains. As a result, their balance sheets can be more challenged. These companies can resolve to reform.&#13;
&#13;
3. A third group faces a fight to survive. Their balance sheets are loaded with debt, their cash reserves are dwindling, and some are highly exposed to geopolitical disruption, particularly from Russia’s war in Ukraine.&#13;
&#13;
4. Finally, a fourth group of mostly newer entrants has, to date, successfully focused on #growth and #market share rather than profitability; however, if they do not pivot to profit, more funding will probably be harder to find.&#13;
&#13;
Even though the article is written with US companies in mind, it is easily applicable to all the companies operating in today's volatile market.&#13;

However, there is a 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗿𝗱 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: 𝗟𝗼𝘄-𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗲/𝗻𝗼-𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 enable organisations to build custom systems without hiring teams of developers or settling for close enough software for administrative tools, workflow or case management systems etc. &#13;
&#13;
𝗔𝘀 𝗽𝗲𝗿 Gartner, 𝗯𝘆 𝗲𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗳 𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟰, 𝟲𝟱% 𝗼𝗳 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝘄𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗯𝗲 𝗺𝗮𝗱𝗲 𝗯𝘆 𝗹𝗼𝘄-𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗲/𝗻𝗼-𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗲.&#13;
&#13;
Managers must understand how they work and what they are good for in order to make proper use of them: small business transactions, small-scale automation, analytics, and website development are all good use cases.&#13;
&#13;
There are also management issues to consider: the proliferation of applications created by "citizen developers" can lead to a shadow IT problem in which only one user understands how the system works. Department managers should be encouraged to facilitate Low-Code/No-Code development and educated on how the technology works, what tools are supported by the organisation, and the desired relationship between citizen developers and the IT organisation.&#13;
&#13;
These applications do not achieve these benefits by magic; rather, they delegate development to users rather than professional system developers. Users can usually design and implement their individual or departmental systems in a few hours using point-and-click or pull-down menu interfaces.&#13;
&#13;
𝗥𝗼𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 (𝗥𝗣𝗔), for example, is one of the fastest-growing LC/NC system categories. It allows users to design automated workflows that can reach multiple information systems by using rules for simple decision-making. This is ideal for automating administrative processes in the back office.&#13;
&#13;
The low-code workflow or 𝗰𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺𝘀 (a modern take on traditional business process management tools); virtual assistants or chatbot tools; and function-specific marketing tools are other examples of LC/NC tools.&#13;

&#13;
Instead of buying a machine outright, you can now pay a monthly fee to use one. The term “machine as a service” (MaaS) is used to describe the outsourcing of the management and maintenance of machinery to a specialist service provider. The service provider is responsible for ensuring that the machinery is kept in good working order and is available to the customer on an as-needed basis. &#13;
&#13;
MaaS arrangements are becoming increasingly popular as businesses seek to reduce their costs and free up their own staff to focus on their core activities. There are a number of advantages to using a MaaS provider, including access to expertise and specialist equipment, lower costs, and increased flexibility. First, it can be cheaper than buying a machine outright, since you're only paying for the use of the machine, not the entire purchase price. Second, it can be more convenient, since the company takes care of maintenance and repairs. &#13;
&#13;
MaaS providers typically offer a range of services, from simple repair and maintenance services to more comprehensive support packages that include regular servicing, 24/7 support, and emergency call-out services. When choosing a MaaS provider, it is important to consider their experience, reputation, and the range of services they offer. You should also make sure that you are clear about the terms of the agreement, including any charges for call-outs or other services.&#13;
&#13;
 So if you're in the market for a new machine, but don't want the hassle of owning one, consider a machine as a service. It just might be the perfect solution for you.&#13;

&#13;
Cross-functional collaboration isn't just a buzzword – it's the heartbeat of digital transformation. Silos? They hinder progress. It's teamwork that optimizes processes and catapults value to customers.&#13;
&#13;
Think about it:&#13;
&#13;
• How clear are roles in your organization?&#13;
• Are feedback loops tight and frequent?&#13;
• When was the last time a joint success was celebrated?&#13;
&#13;
Real digital change isn't just about technology. It's about dynamism across functions, roles, and boundaries. Embrace it. Lead the revolution, not just the evolution.&#13;
&#13;
🎉Audit your current collaboration process. Break walls, build bridges. And remember, success tastes better celebrated together.&#13;

Why?&#13;
&#13;
It's an Armistice Day. A day which we commemorate every year on 11th November to mark the armistice signed between the Allies of World War I and Germany at Compiègne, France, at 5:45 am for the cessation of hostilities on the Western Front of World War I, which took effect at eleven in the morning—the "eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month" of 1918. &#13;
&#13;
To commemorate their victims, people in Serbia wear Natalie's Ramonda as a symbol of remembrance. It is an endangered species that grows in eastern Serbia and on the highest peak of Kajmakčalan, where the Serbian army under the command of Duke Živojin Mišić fought fiercely against the Bulgarians on Thessaloniki front to create conditions for breakthrough. The symbolism of the flower is multiple, and it is also known as the phoenix flower, because even if it dries completely when watered, it can come to life, which symbolically indicates the resurrection of the Serbian state from the ashes after the First World War.&#13;
&#13;
Serbia paid a disproportionately high price for the victory in the Great War. The Serbian forces suffered the largest casualty rate in World War I. In one of the most terrible conflicts the world has ever seen, according to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, Serbia lost 1.247.435 people, or 28 percent of the total population it had according to the 1914 census, or 60 percent of the male population.  &#13;
&#13;
On the 11th of November Serbia remembers with pride and reverence hundreds of thousands of civilians and warriors, innocently and heroically killed in the battles for the defence and liberation of the homeland during the four war years.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Often, C-level managers perceive digital transformation only as implementing another digital tool that will "help" the company to become more "digital" or productive. This is very far from what digital transformation or better we say business transformation is.&#13;
&#13;
Digital transformation is about changing where value is created, and how your business model is structured. More and more, value creation comes from outside the firm not inside, and from external partners rather than internal employees. In the article attached this new production model is an “inverted firm,” a change in organizational structure that affects not only the technology but also the managerial governance that attends it. &#13;
&#13;
Executives must understand and undertake partner relationship management, partner data management, partner product management, platform governance, and platform strategy. They must learn how to motivate people they don’t know to share ideas they don’t have.&#13;

&#13;
Pick up any industry or professional publication and you’ll be deluged with articles extolling the value of digital transformation. Supporters tout new capabilities as do-or-die. “All companies must become tech companies” is a common refrain. “Organizations that speed their decision intelligence capabilities will survive, and those that don’t will fail” is another.&#13;
&#13;
There is an enormous potential for new digital capabilities to improve business performance, create more satisfying jobs, and solve some long-standing issues that have proven beyond the reach of methods typically employed today.&#13;
&#13;
Still, adaptation and change remain challenges for most companies. All change, even the smallest, depends on trust. The problem is that, too often, business departments simply do not trust their IT counterparts. Until this problem is tackled and solved, critical initiatives around digital transformation will stall.&#13;

Often, those actions involve what’s commonly called “digital transformation”—implementing new tools, platforms, and business models to create competitive differentiation. &#13;
&#13;
But while CEOs constantly hear that they should lead any significant digital transformation, it’s not always easy to know exactly how to do that. As technology continues to grow in complexity, it is harder for CEOs to take a direct role in leading these transformations. At the same time, intensifying environmental disruption makes transformation an increasingly strategic lever that CEOs must lead. &#13;

So, what’s a CEO to do?&#13;

𝘞𝘩𝘺 𝘪𝘴 𝘪𝘵 𝘣𝘦𝘭𝘪𝘦𝘷𝘢𝘣𝘭𝘦?&#13;
Agile businesses, particularly start-ups, seem to turn on a dime and don't appear to have any kind of plan. It's easy to believe that what you see an agile firm doing - acting quickly, maintaining a high tempo, and being highly responsive - is all there is.&#13;
&#13;
𝘞𝘩𝘺 𝘪𝘵’𝘴 𝘸𝘳𝘰𝘯𝘨&#13;
It is not a strategy to be agile. It is a capability, although a very valuable one with immediate operational benefits, but it cannot permanently affect a firm's competitive position unless the right decisions are made about where to direct that capability. And the apparent lack of a plan does not imply that successful start-ups lack strategies. A strategy is not a plan; it is a decision-making framework, a set of guiding principles that can be applied as the situation evolves. Most businesses fail because being able to turn on a dime does not guarantee that you will turn in the right direction. Successful start-ups spend a lot of time debating fundamentals and asking tough questions.&#13;
&#13;
Successful start-ups do a lot of hard thinking about fundamentals, questioning and testing basic assumptions with the rigour that incumbents would do well to imitate. Start-ups must do so because their resources are extremely limited. If they do not have a coherent strategy, they will make poor resource allocation decisions, which will result in death rather than a drop in earnings.&#13;

&#13;
Close to three in four global businesses (72%) are forging ahead with digital expansion, despite economic concerns, supply chain challenges, and skills issues. And, at least half of executives are looking at Web3 as a viable option moving forward.&#13;
&#13;
Many executives intend to take advantage of emerging technologies such as 5G, the internet of things (IoT), and Web3. Almost two-thirds (62%) said their business has already put a Web3 strategy in place, while 34% said they do not have a Web3 strategy yet. A plurality of executives (44%) even expect Web3 to replace the current infrastructure within the next one to five years, and 16% even believe it will happen in the next year.&#13;
&#13;
That’s the word from Equinix, which released a survey of 2,900 IT executives across the world, showing no letup in plans for major investments in digital technologies to support ambitious expansion plans.&#13;

But when the generative AI tool ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, burst into the mainstream at the end of 2022, it accelerated and compounded our deepest underlying fear about the tech: that AI will usurp our jobs.&#13;
&#13;
But beyond the hype, the reality is very different. Indeed, the generative AI genie is well and truly out of the bottle: it will transform the ways workers interact with each other and their employers or clients. But it won’t decimate all jobs. Rather, it will evolve them, and in some cases could even create more jobs.&#13;

The results are evident – ICT now accounts for almost 𝟲% 𝗼𝗳 𝗚𝗗𝗣 and the country is one of the leading nations in the region in terms of ICT development.&#13;
&#13;
The Serbian government has been investing heavily in ICT infrastructure and development, with the aim of making the country more attractive to foreign investors and increasing its competitiveness. One of the most notable initiatives is the "Digital Serbia" strategy, which was launched in 2013 and has a large budget. The strategy includes a number of measures to promote the use of digital technologies in the economy and society.&#13;
&#13;
So far, the results have been very positive and Serbia is now well on its way to becoming a digital economy. However, there are still some challenges that need to be addressed in order to fully reap the benefits of digitalization.&#13;
&#13;
One of the biggest challenges is the 𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗼𝗳 𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗱 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗲𝗿𝘀. While the number of ICT graduates has increased in recent years, there is still a shortage of qualified workers. This is a major challenge for the country's economy, as ICT is one of the fastest-growing sectors.&#13;
&#13;
Another 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗹𝗼𝘄 𝗹𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹 𝗼𝗳 𝗱𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘆 among the population. A large portion of the population does not have the skills or knowledge to use digital technologies effectively. This is a major barrier to the further development of the digital economy.&#13;
&#13;
Despite these challenges, Serbia has a lot to offer in terms of digitalization. The country has a well-developed ICT infrastructure and a growing number of highly-skilled workers. Additionally, the government is committed to further developing the digital economy and making Serbia an attractive destination for foreign investors.&#13;
&#13;
Digitalization offers a number of benefits to the Serbian economy. It can increase efficiency and productivity, create new jobs, and attract foreign investment. Additionally, digital technologies can help to reduce corruption and improve the delivery of public services.&#13;
&#13;
The digitalization of the Serbian economy is an ongoing process with many benefits. However, there are still some challenges that need to be addressed in order to fully reap the benefits of digitalization.&#13;

This low level of digital maturity is a major problem for businesses. In today's digital world, companies must be able to use digital technologies to remain competitive.&#13;
&#13;
There are several different ways to assess digital maturity and all include holistic assessments of the business. There are many benefits to assessing the digital maturity of enterprises. By doing so, companies can identify areas where they need to improve their digital capabilities. Additionally, digital maturity assessments can help organizations benchmark their progress and compare themselves to other companies. At the beginning of a digital transformation, companies use digital maturity assessments to holistically assess the businesses by covering many categories, such as customer journeys, digital supply chain, marketing personalization, governance, innovation, technology, customer, operations, and people. This early benchmarking becomes exponentially more valuable over the course of a digital transformation as companies track digital growth to identify where they’re gaining traction and where they’re falling behind. &#13;
&#13;
Businesses with high levels of digital maturity have a competitive advantage along multiple performance indicators, including revenue growth, time to market, cost efficiency, product quality, and customer satisfaction. Businesses with low levels of digital maturity struggle to achieve these benefits. Digital maturity assessments can be beneficial for companies of all sizes. By assessing their digital maturity, companies can identify areas where they need to improve and make changes to become more digital. &#13;
&#13;
Given digital’s continued contribution to company performance, the gap between digital leaders and laggards will likely grow.&#13;

&#13;
By tracking changes in vibration frequency and amplitude, a predictive maintenance program can enable decision-making to maximize the cost-benefit of allowing a non-essential and easily replaced part to fail, vs. maximizing the run time of a process-critical part. &#13;
&#13;
Many modern vibration sensors include AI/ML technology that interprets the data to help the team make smarter decisions. Before implementing a predictive maintenance program, it's important to consider &#13;
• how the new sensor data will integrate with existing tech and operating processes, &#13;
• the human-based actions that will be driven by the new data, and &#13;
• the automated processes that will be driven across the tech stack to maximize value through integration with purchasing, planning, and maintenance management systems.&#13;

The benefits of digital transformation have been widely acclaimed, including increased enterprise agility, improved efficiency, and the incorporation of new stakeholders with pertinent skills.&#13;
&#13;
From a strategic perspective, being dynamic across digital channels is crucial to the survival and growth of businesses today. This is because modern-day customers prioritize the experience of using the product rather than the product itself. Therefore, 𝗱𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗳𝗹𝘂𝗶𝗱𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗶𝘀 𝗮 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗶𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗼𝗿𝗴𝗮𝗻𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗻𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗮𝗱𝗮𝗽𝘁 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗹𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗲𝘁𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲. By embracing change, businesses can mirror the evolving needs of their customers and retain their brand loyalty by providing an agile user experience.&#13;
&#13;
In this context, digital transformation assumes an increased sense of importance in shaping enterprise strategy. It is a fundamental tool that facilitates enterprises to adapt and evolve with changing times, technology, and customer needs. Enterprises that have implemented digital transformation are better equipped to meet the demands of their customers and remain competitive in the market.&#13;

&#13;
Intelligent-automation solutions can help to achieve efficiency and effectiveness gains, and support decision making by extracting new insights from complex data. But, as with other forms of AI, they can also increase risks for the business and lead to increased scrutiny by regulators: these tools and technologies could ultimately affect the delivery of critical business services to the surrounding ecosystem.&#13;
&#13;
Most companies do not yet have the appropriate structures and tools to effectively manage the risks and returns of intelligent automation. Specifically, different aspects of system development and operation (such as implementation and system management, risk and resilience management, and business-process optimization) are often managed by various functions in a fragmented way. Furthermore, organizations typically lack robust frameworks, processes, and infrastructure to ensure the effective risk and return assessment of AI and automation. It’s therefore increasingly critical for companies to incorporate automation-specific considerations into their broader AI- and digital-risk-management programs.&#13;

&#13;
Based on Accenture research, most have launched pilots to validate the potential of harnessing data and advanced analytics to improve their operations, and the most advanced have charted roadmaps to adaptive operations.&#13;
&#13;
However, there is still uncertainty around existing manufacturing systems architecture, emerging &#13;
technology and their ability to support these roadmaps and the deployment at scale of the related use cases.&#13;
&#13;
Use cases such as predictive maintenance or vision-based in-line inspection are relatively well understood. &#13;
&#13;
Software providers ranging from specialized start-ups to large, established software vendors sell specific niche solutions for such use cases. However, as manufacturers strive to progress further and faster toward end-to-end adaptive operations, they face common challenges:&#13;
&#13;
1. The siloed nature of traditional manufacturing architectures doesn’t support the tackling of the &#13;
highest value use cases, which often require reaching beyond individual assets or lines and beyond one single function, like maintenance or quality.&#13;
&#13;
2. The related solutions require the handling of vast amounts of data, which often exceeds the specs for existing architectures.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Companies have been working to become more data-driven for many years at this point, with mixed results. These efforts play out over time in organizations, and persistence, resilience, execution, and a relentless drive to employ data to make more informed business decisions are what distinguishes those companies that prevail from those who continue to struggle.&#13;
&#13;
Right now, the biggest challenge for organizations working on their data strategy might not have to do with technology at all. In the latest NewVantage Partners annual survey, which tracks the progress of corporate data initiatives, corporate chief data, information, and analytics executives reported that cultural change is the most critical business imperative. It’s an understandable problem: to a degree that is perpetually underestimated, becoming data-driven is about the ability of people and organizations to adapt to change. Long-established companies, which have been successful over generations or centuries, are unlikely to change overnight — adoption of the internet through digital transformation efforts has played out over the course of the past quarter century. Similarly, the effort by companies to become data-driven represents a business transformation that is playing out over the course of a generation. Much has been achieved, yet more remains to be done.&#13;
&#13;
Becoming a data-driven organization is a journey, which unfolds over time, measured in years, and sometimes decades. What steps can organizations and business leaders take to accelerate these efforts? Experience tells us that data-driven organizations consistently demonstrate qualities that distinguish them from their contemporaries. Data-driven companies consistently execute on these three driving principles:&#13;
&#13;
1. Think different.&#13;
2. Fail fast, learn faster.&#13;
3. Focus on the long-term. &#13;

While factory automation (Industry 3.0) helped improve the performance of all sorts of factories around the world in the past few decades, there are considerable opportunities beyond standard factory automation. &#13;
&#13;
Once machines are interconnected and managed by IoT sensors and actuators, it is possible to improve asset utilization significantly by using auto-sensing equipment to eliminate many of the human and machine errors that reduce productivity. Remote monitoring, tracking, and control of equipment and workflow can produce additional savings, including substantial energy savings. And using sensors to determine when machines need service can prevent breakdowns and save on routine maintenance costs.&#13;

It's time for a new approach: life-centricity. 95% of both B2C and B2B executives told that they believe their customers are changing faster than they can change their businesses.&#13;
&#13;
Accenture's research has found that businesses focused on life centricity are 𝟯𝘅 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 likely to outperform peers on speed-to-market and almost 𝟱𝘅 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 likely to outperform on customer lifetime value.&#13;
&#13;
After years of global volatility, companies need new strategies to thrive amid the upheaval. Meanwhile, people are becoming increasingly unpredictable as economic, social, environmental and political forces push them to continuously reassess their values and decisions.&#13;
&#13;
Many are turning to technology to reshape their operations, but finding it isn’t enough: Though nearly all executives are accelerating their digital transformations, an astounding 97% acknowledge that, at best, such efforts merely allow them to keep pace, not fuel new growth.&#13;
&#13;
The research, however, discovered an interesting discovery: some companies are beginning to break out. The highest growth companies in our study are widening their strategic aperture, transforming in ways that position them to drive new growth and relevance. They’re using technology more creatively to solve emerging customer needs. Most importantly, our analysis found that companies gaining momentum are not using strategies that are product-centric, or customer-centric—they are becoming life-centric.&#13;
&#13;
A life-centric approach is built on understanding that people are multifaceted and that they embrace their own complexity. It involves keeping a finger on the pulse of the external forces that impact modern life (whether economic, social, cultural or beyond) and finding ways to respond that create value for all. Companies with life-centric strategies are willing to make bold, creative changes to the heart of what they do, whether that means upending business models and internal operations or reimagining who their customers are.&#13;

Low code enables companies to reduce costs and the time required to develop solutions, fostering innovation and agility. Based on agile development methodologies, cross-functional teams from business and IT can be empowered to innovate, experiment, make mistakes without fear, and develop faster, accelerating their digital transformation journey.&#13;
&#13;
To be able to realize the expected benefits of low-code development, a change in thinking and culture is necessary for many companies. Successful low-code implementation must address not only the employees but also IT and business managers, to provide coordinated guidelines and show promising ways to be able to transform the topic strategically. This requires a proper governance model to achieve the full value of low code. This helps ensure that IT and business stakeholders are aligned with business goals and that business value is created. At the same time, it should foster innovation and productivity and not hinder process stakeholders through excessive bureaucracy. &#13;

&#13;
Companies across the globe see and act upon the need for compressed transformation to remain relevant while becoming more resilient and responsible. This includes the transformation of a core piece of their business – manufacturing. Three burning platforms are driving them toward the next digital frontier:&#13;
1. The still ongoing pandemic has accelerated the change.&#13;
2. Software redefines physical products. &#13;
3. The sustainability imperative depends on digital.&#13;
&#13;
All three developments are landmarks of the next digital frontier ahead for most manufacturers. They pose significant challenges to how customer and employee-relevant manufacturers will remain, how resilient they will be and how responsibly they can act. &#13;
&#13;
🎯The technologies are available and have proven their worth and both the need and the benefits of digital manufacturing are obvious. Companies that connect technology intelligently and manage the change it brings wisely can go well beyond the efficiency and effectiveness scenarios that Industry 4.0 provides.&#13;

Some roles might be eliminated, while others may have to be reorganized. It could challenge existing operational standards or require the development of new skills. &#13;
&#13;
📌 It all comes to great 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗮𝘀 𝗮 𝗰𝗿𝘂𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗻𝗲𝗻𝘁 of digital transformation. It requires establishing the appropriate environment for change, involving leaders and employees, and reinforcing new behaviours throughout the organization.&#13;
&#13;
The process of transformation, from initiation to stabilization, entails various changes that affect the human aspect. It’s understandable that people often experience feelings of uncertainty and fear, which can sometimes create barriers in the execution process. This resistance may lead to suboptimal solution development, time delays, cost overruns, and other unwanted outcomes, which can, in turn, harm the overall transformation journey. This leads to the conclusion that poorly managed changes become a major reason for most of the digital transformations to fail- 𝗮𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱 𝟳𝟬% 𝗼𝗳 𝗶𝘁 (as per McKinsey &amp; Company).&#13;

&#13;
𝗠𝗮𝗻𝘂𝗮𝗹 𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗮𝗰𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗵𝗮𝗹𝗳 𝗼𝗳 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝘂𝗳𝗮𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘀 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼𝗱𝗮𝘆.&#13;
• An analysis of North American and European manufacturing jobs revealed that roughly 48 per cent of hours were spent on manual or physical labour.&#13;
• It is estimated that by 2030, only 35% of the time will be spent on such routine work.&#13;
&#13;
𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘄𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗯𝗲 𝗳𝗲𝗹𝘁 𝗯𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗺𝗶𝗱-𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟬𝘀.&#13;
• According to a recent PwC report, the impact on OECD jobs will be felt in the mid-2020s.&#13;
• By 2025, for example, it is expected that 10-15% of jobs in three industries (manufacturing, transportation and storage, and wholesale and retail trade) will be highly automated.&#13;
• By 2035, the range of jobs with high automation potential in those sectors will be closer to 35-50 per cent.&#13;
&#13;
𝗜𝗻𝗱𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗼𝘁 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗲𝘀 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗱𝗲𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴.&#13;
• Industrial robot sales are skyrocketing, owing primarily to falling industry costs.&#13;
• This trend is expected to continue, with robot costs falling by 66% between 2015 and 2025.&#13;
• With the general cost of labour rising, it is becoming more difficult to keep low-skilled jobs.&#13;
&#13;
𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝘆 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗲𝗼𝘂𝘀𝗹𝘆 𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀 𝗷𝗼𝗯𝘀, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝘆?&#13;
• One bright spot is that automation and AI will create jobs, most likely in functions that we cannot imagine today.&#13;
• Technology has historically created more jobs than it has destroyed.&#13;
• AI alone is expected to have a $15.7 trillion economic impact by 2030.&#13;
&#13;
Unfortunately, while experts agree that these technologies will create jobs, they disagree on how many. This significant disparity is likely to be the deciding factor in determining the ultimate impact of these technologies in the coming years, particularly on the workforce.&#13;

&#13;
⚡Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) represent 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝟵𝟬% 𝗼𝗳 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗯𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 and more than half of employment worldwide. They play an acutely important role in the global economy — and they can play a role in responding to the climate crisis, too.&#13;
&#13;
Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) can help SMEs reduce waste, optimize operations and monitor processes more effectively.&#13;
&#13;
Estimates show that the average price of IoT sensors has declined over the last 2 decades — from $𝟭.𝟯𝟬 𝗶𝗻 𝟮𝟬𝟬𝟰 𝘁𝗼 $𝟬.𝟯𝟴 𝗶𝗻 𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟬. This price drop has been fuelled by an increased number of suppliers, more optimized and efficient technology and falling cost of connection, storage and processing. As IoT technologies become more accessible, SMEs are in better positions to embrace simple yet proven IoT technology applications that will make their businesses more profitable and sustainable.&#13;

One of the most promising technologies in this space is the Digital Twin. A Digital Twin is a virtual replica of an object, process, or system that allows retailers to simulate and analyze real-world scenarios, improving efficiency, reducing costs, and driving revenue growth.&#13;
&#13;
According to a study by Accenture, 𝗿𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝘄𝗵𝗼 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗗𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗧𝘄𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝘆 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗲𝗻 𝗮𝗻 𝗮𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝟯𝟬% 𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗶𝗻 𝗲𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆, 𝟮𝟬% 𝗿𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝗻 𝗰𝗼𝘀𝘁𝘀, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝟭𝟱% 𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗶𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘂𝗲.&#13;
&#13;
Using Digital Twin technology in retail can help improve inventory management by providing real-time data on stock levels and sales trends, allowing retailers to optimize inventory and reduce waste. Additionally, Digital Twins can simulate store layouts, helping retailers to optimize store design and layout to improve the customer experience, leading to increased sales and customer loyalty.&#13;
&#13;
Digital Twin technology can also be used in supply chain management, allowing retailers to optimize logistics and reduce costs. By simulating supply chain scenarios, retailers can identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies and take steps to address them. This can help retailers to improve their delivery time and customer satisfaction.&#13;
&#13;
However, it's important to note that the implementation of Digital Twin technology should be part of a broader digital transformation strategy. To ensure success, retailers should involve internal stakeholders, address concerns about job loss, and have a deep understanding of how the changes will affect the customer experience. It's also important for retailers to consider the risks and challenges associated with digital transformation, such as cyber threats and data privacy concerns, and implement the necessary measures to mitigate them.&#13;
&#13;
Digital Twin technology is still in the early stages of adoption in the retail industry, but the potential benefits are clear. Retailers who are looking to stay ahead of the curve and drive growth should consider how they can leverage this technology to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the customer experience.&#13;

Digital ecosystems are not a new concept, but they are evolving rapidly thanks to the convergence of technologies such as IoT, edge computing, 5G, and cloud. These technologies enable the development of digital twins, which are virtual representations of physical assets, processes, and/or systems. There are a lot of use cases of Digital twins for every industry. They can be used to monitor, optimize, and control complex systems across different domains and industries, like in:&#13;
&#13;
• 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Imagine a digital twin of a railway system that can optimize the operations, maintenance, and safety of trains, tracks, and stations.&#13;
• 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗼𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲: Having a connected vehicle fleet that can communicate with each other, the infrastructure, and the cloud to provide enhanced services, such as autonomous driving, smart parking, and personalized entertainment.&#13;
• 𝗟𝗼𝗴𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰𝘀: Imagine a connected logistics hub that can streamline the flow of goods and people, reduce costs and emissions, and improve security and customer satisfaction.&#13;
• 𝗛𝗲𝗮𝗹𝘁𝗵𝗰𝗮𝗿𝗲: A hospital can leverage data from IoT devices, edge computing, and the cloud to provide better care for patients, improve workflows for staff, and enable remote diagnosis and treatment.&#13;
• 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝘂𝗳𝗮𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴: Smart factories can use unmanned autonomous vehicles, sensors, and edge computing to automate production processes, increase efficiency and quality, and prevent downtime.&#13;
&#13;
These are just some of the use cases that next-gen digital ecosystems can enable. To realize them, we need to have a holistic approach that considers the aspects like low-latency mobile communication, near-source data processing (edge computing) and digital twins.&#13;

&#13;
Many digital transformation initiatives fail to deliver promised benefits. Some even damage operational effectiveness and customer experience. Where do transformations go wrong? Consider these pitfalls:&#13;
&#13;
1. Lack of leadership commitment - Transformation requires ongoing C-suite sponsorship and culture change.&#13;
2. Poor change management - Employees resist changes without proper communication and training.&#13;
3. Technology-first approach - Digital tools get layered on broken processes rather than driving process reinvention.&#13;
4. Unclear goals and metrics - Benefits are not precisely defined and tracked.&#13;
5. Insufficient funding and resources - Transformation needs multi-year investment and talent.&#13;
According to a McKinsey study, 70% of digital transformations fall short of expected benefits. &#13;
&#13;
📌 Avoid deterioration - take an agile, customer-focused approach. Continuously re-evaluate processes, data and performance metrics. Ensure strong leadership alignment, change management and reskilling programs. &#13;
&#13;
With proper planning and support, digital transformation delivers an enormous competitive advantage. &#13;

&#13;
Many organisations aspire to undergo a transformation, but often they mistakenly initiate a mere change instead of a genuine transformation.&#13;
&#13;
What’s the difference?&#13;
&#13;
⇨ Change fixes the past&#13;
&#13;
⇨ Transformation creates the future&#13;
&#13;
The chances of achieving what you want will increase when you become clearer about what you want.&#13;
&#13;
⇨ Do you want a better version of now? (change)&#13;
&#13;
⇨ Or something new? (transformation)&#13;
&#13;
Change requires becoming familiar with the current situation, and working to make things faster, better, and cheaper.&#13;
&#13;
The reference point for change is the past.&#13;
&#13;
Transformation is a declaration that your effort will create a new future, which is free from the constraints of the past.&#13;
&#13;
The reference point for transformation is the future.&#13;
&#13;
If you want to transform your organisation, you need to have a clear vision of the future you want to create and align your actions with that vision.&#13;
&#13;
You also need to have the courage to let go of the past and embrace the unknown.&#13;
&#13;
Transformation is not easy, but it is rewarding.&#13;
&#13;
It can help you create a competitive advantage, foster innovation, and unleash your potential.&#13;

So instead, look for things that the culture will welcome and that will advance the data culture that is desired. Showing how a data program will support that mission increases the chances of success.&#13;
&#13;
The new culture should be built from day one, even if it is not the main goal. This goes against the common wisdom, which suggests that quick wins are needed to gain support. But quick win efforts often take shortcuts, ignoring people and culture and making these projects more likely to fail. Moreover, successful quick wins may make companies think they can ignore people and culture, setting themselves up for future failures. Instead, aim for “significant wins,” that fully embrace business results, structure, people, and culture.&#13;
&#13;
To change a culture, everyone needs to be involved. Cultures change through actions, not words. So it is important to send a message about what people need to do, not just how companies want them to think or feel.&#13;
&#13;
Data quality should be given strong consideration as the starting point. While many see data quality as the most boring topic in all of the data, it is a great way to get everyone involved and it is essential.&#13;
&#13;
A great data program cannot be built on bad data.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
A Blue Ocean strategy is a business strategy that is used in order to create new demand in an uncontested market space. This strategy is used in order to avoid the intense competition that is usually seen in markets that have been well established. The goal of a blue ocean strategy is to create new demand in a market that doesn't exist yet. &#13;
&#13;
In order to create a blue ocean, businesses need to first understand the difference between value and price. Value is the combination of benefits that a customer receives from a product or service. Price is the amount of money that a customer is willing to pay for a product or service. In order to create a blue ocean, businesses need to focus on creating value for their customers. &#13;
&#13;
There are four steps that businesses need to take in order to create a blue ocean: &#13;
&#13;
1. Define what your company does in terms of the customer experience&#13;
2. Map out the current state of the customer experience&#13;
3. Identify areas for improvement in the customer experience&#13;
4. Create a plan to improve the customer experience&#13;
&#13;
By following these steps, businesses can create a blue ocean strategy that will help them to avoid the intense competition in well-established markets and create new demand in markets that don't exist yet.&#13;

&#13;
The digitally enabled factory of today looks very different from the leading factory of ten years ago. Advances in data and analytics, AI, and ML—and the array of technology vendors in the market—mean manufacturers can choose from hundreds of potential solutions and tech applications to improve their ways of working.&#13;
&#13;
Implemented successfully, these solutions deliver irresistible returns. Across a wide range of sectors, it is not uncommon to see 𝟯𝟬 𝘁𝗼 𝟱𝟬 𝗽𝗲𝗿 𝗰𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗿𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗺𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗱𝗼𝘄𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲, 𝟭𝟬 𝘁𝗼 𝟯𝟬 𝗽𝗲𝗿 𝗰𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵𝗽𝘂𝘁, 𝟭𝟱 𝘁𝗼 𝟯𝟬 𝗽𝗲𝗿 𝗰𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗶𝘁𝘆, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝟴𝟱 𝗽𝗲𝗿 𝗰𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗰𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴.&#13;
&#13;
Digital transformations are revolutionising all aspects of manufacturing, touching not just processes and productivity but also people. The right applications of technology can lead to more empowered decision-making; new opportunities for upskilling, reskilling, and cross-functional collaboration; better talent attraction and retention; and improved workplace safety and employee satisfaction.&#13;
&#13;
Customers see the impacts through reduced manufacturing lead times, right-first-time launch management, and improved customer service and complexity management. And, of course, there are the win–win advantages associated with reduced environmental impact, made possible through lower emissions and reduced waste and more efficient energy, water, and raw-material consumption.&#13;
&#13;
Whether manufacturers are starting out on their digital transformation journeys—or recalibrating their approach after false starts or failed attempts—the approaches adopted by leading companies point to seven golden principles for scaling a successful digital transformation:&#13;
&#13;
1. Communicate well and often&#13;
2. Be specific&#13;
3. Segment, select, and syndicate&#13;
4. Formalise the value at stake&#13;
5. Develop a three- to five-year vision for the network&#13;
6. Design a digital-manufacturing road map&#13;
7. Syndicate the vision and secure leadership buy-in&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Companies have been working to become more data-driven for many years at this point, with mixed results. These efforts play out over time in organizations, and persistence, resilience, execution, and a relentless drive to employ data to make more informed business decisions are what distinguish those companies that prevail from those who continue to struggle.&#13;
&#13;
Right now, the biggest challenge for organizations working on their data strategy might not have to do with technology at all. In the latest NewVantage Partners annual survey, which tracks the progress of corporate data initiatives, corporate chief data, information, and analytics executives reported that cultural change is the most critical business imperative. It’s an understandable problem: to the degree that is perpetually underestimated, becoming data-driven is about the ability of people and organizations to adapt to change. Long-established companies, which have been successful over generations or centuries, are unlikely to change overnight — the adoption of the internet through digital transformation efforts has played out over the course of the past quarter century. Similarly, the effort by companies to become data-driven represents a business transformation that is playing out over the course of a generation. Much has been achieved, yet more remains to be done.&#13;
&#13;
Becoming a data-driven organization is a journey, which unfolds over time, measured in years, and sometimes decades. What steps can organizations and business leaders take to accelerate these efforts? Experience tells us that data-driven organizations consistently demonstrate qualities that distinguish them from their contemporaries. Data-driven companies consistently execute these three driving principles:&#13;
&#13;
1. Think different.&#13;
2. Fail fast, learn faster.&#13;
3. Focus on the long-term. &#13;

Nakon mog povratka u Srbiju, pre godinu ipo dana, u kontaktima sa predstavnicima Privredna komora Srbije i Vlada Republike Srbije- Kabinet ministra za inovacije i tehnološki razvoj (Vlade Republike Srbije), između ostalog, upravo sam predlagao otvaranje centra za Industriju 4. &#13;
&#13;
Na osnovu prethodnog ličnog iskustva u otvaranju ili opremanju i organizaciji ovakvih centara na Bliskom Istoku, naveo sam i čitav spektar potrebnih segmenata Industrije 4 koji bi bili pokriveni, kao i benefite za industrijski sektor Srbije. Ključne aktivnosti bi bile:&#13;
&#13;
1. Detaljna analiza stanja digitalizacije industrije&#13;
2. Izrada Strategije za Četvrtu industrijsku revoluciju i digitalizaciju svih grana industrije u Srbiji&#13;
3. Pilot-projekat evaluacije i odabira 5 ili 10 kompanija pod pokroviteljstvom PKS&#13;
4. Podrška i otvaranje Inovacionog Centra za Industry 4.0&#13;
5. Smanjenje Carbon Footprint-a &#13;
 &#13;
&#13;
Takođe, pregled gde je sad Srbija u odnosu na zemlje regiona u pogledu nekih ključnih indikatora u stepenu razvoja dati su u dokumentu ispod. Izvor upravo World Economic Forum (s kojim je Vlada Republike Srbije i potpisala sporazum).&#13;

&#13;
Intelligence in AI refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as understanding language, recognizing images and solving problems. &#13;
&#13;
Computational complexity, on the other hand, is the measure of how difficult it is to solve a problem using an algorithm, considering factors like the amount of data and processing power required. Together, these two concepts shape the current and future capabilities of AI, as well as its limitations.&#13;

However, this can be avoided by prioritizing value creation from the start.&#13;
&#13;
McKinsey have developed a "tech forward" model that consists of three interrelated vectors and ten specific plays, or areas of action.&#13;
&#13;
These plays are not new to CIOs, but they are often overlooked or underutilized. The model helps organizations assess the magnitude of change required and to coordinate the actions across vectors and plays.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Where traditional factories and even smart factories require some direct human interaction, true lights-out factories operate completely autonomously.&#13;
&#13;
Though it might sound like a dream, lights-out factories are fully automated, 24/7 factories with no on-floor human presence. And they already exist in the modern world.&#13;
&#13;
Japanese robotics designer FANUC has been using robots to build themselves in a lights-out factory for 20 years, and even electronics company Philips uses 128 robots in a lights-out manufacturing line to produce electric razors.&#13;
&#13;
One industry that uses lights-out manufacturing extensively is semiconductor manufacturing. ASE Global, the world’s leading provider of semiconductor manufacturing services in assembly and test, used 18 completely automated factories in 2020 alone.&#13;
&#13;
Which industries will implement lights-out manufacturing? New robot installations in 2019 show that the automotive, electronics, and metal and machinery sectors are unsurprisingly leading the way in Industry 4.0 implementation.&#13;

History shows that new technologies have not caused mass unemployment in the long run, so AI is not likely to leave many people without work in the future — especially since most developed countries are now facing a shrinking workforce. However, because ChatGPT and other generative AI are being adopted by companies at a rapid pace, we may see significant job disruption in the short term.&#13;
&#13;
Companies are embracing AI in their operations so fast that job losses may outstrip job gains. White-collar workers may be particularly at risk in the short-term. The speed of this adoption creates an opportunity for companies to accelerate their innovation, though — and if enough companies take the initiative, then we won’t have to worry about AI unemployment. Adopting a bold and entrepreneurial mindset will help companies find the flexibility to seize this opportunity, and safeguard jobs as a result.&#13;

In addition to lowering costs, improving efficiency and building resilience, digital investments can mitigate risks and address environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues.&#13;
&#13;
PwC did a survey on digital trends in supply chain and found out that more than two-thirds of executives expect digitizing their supply chain to require some upskilling of employees. 📌𝗕𝘂𝘁 𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗽𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗹𝘆, 𝗼𝗻𝗹𝘆 𝟳% 𝘀𝗮𝗶𝗱 𝗱𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝘂𝗽𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘄𝗮𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗶𝗿 𝘁𝗼𝗽 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆.&#13;
&#13;
A lack of digital skills among employees (80%) and the availability of data and digital tools (73%) were the most commonly cited challenges to integrating ESG into company supply chains.&#13;
&#13;
Building a workforce that can adapt to different ways of working, particularly through technology, is critical for maintaining resilience in your supply chain.&#13;
&#13;
How do you handle your supply chain digitalization?&#13;

It’s a monumental industry shift.&#13;
&#13;
So, why the hype? What’s the big deal about #low-code? There are two trends we need to consider:&#13;
&#13;
The first is citizen development, a movement that is also not at all new but received a new and catchier name a little over a decade ago. The idea is that you can get more applications built by going past IT and having users do their own development, and since such users already know what they want, there’s no need to communicate requirements and risk confusion. Since few citizens have learned to code, let alone code well, citizen development leans heavily on the use of low-code platforms and tools.&#13;
&#13;
The second trend is continuous improvement, also an old idea in new packaging – but a very worthy one. The notion is that no effort, no process, no product, no method should be set in stone; organizations should collect data, evaluate options, and look for ways to enhance and evolve things. In software, that means applications aren’t so much deliverables as they are ongoing relationships. Various methodologies operating under the banner of Agile reflect this mindset in the world of code, but an emerging supposition is that low-code is easier to adapt and evolve than code – an idea rife with caveats but an emerging idea nevertheless.&#13;
&#13;
What’s really going on is that low-code is incredibly useful to movements that are trending and are in the process of becoming big. Low-code makes many kinds of software development more productive. It’s going to accompany any areas of #innovation, no matter what they are.&#13;
&#13;
And it’s not alone. Artificial intelligence (#ai) shows up all over as well and is rapidly becoming a component one might rely on while working on something else. Business intelligence grows every day and collecting/analysing/reacting to data is again becoming something that is used as a component of something bigger.&#13;

&#13;
𝘞𝘩𝘺 𝘪𝘴 𝘪𝘵 𝘣𝘦𝘭𝘪𝘦𝘷𝘢𝘣𝘭𝘦?&#13;
Agile businesses, particularly start-ups, seem to turn on a dime and don't appear to have any kind of plan. It's easy to believe that what you see an agile firm doing - acting quickly, maintaining a high tempo, and being highly responsive - is all there is.&#13;
&#13;
𝘞𝘩𝘺 𝘪𝘵’𝘴 𝘸𝘳𝘰𝘯𝘨&#13;
𝗜𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗮 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗲 𝗮𝗴𝗶𝗹𝗲. It is a capability, although a very valuable one with immediate operational benefits, it cannot permanently affect a firm's competitive position unless the right decisions are made about where to direct that capability. And the apparent lack of a plan does not imply that successful start-ups lack strategies. A strategy is not a plan; it is a decision-making framework, a set of guiding principles that can be applied as the situation evolves. &#13;
&#13;
Most businesses fail because being able to turn on a dime does not guarantee that you will turn in the right direction. Successful start-ups spend a lot of time debating fundamentals and asking tough questions.&#13;
&#13;
Successful start-ups do a lot of hard thinking about fundamentals, questioning and testing basic assumptions with the rigour that incumbents would do well to imitate. Start-ups must do so because their resources are extremely limited. &#13;
&#13;
If they do not have a coherent strategy, they will make poor resource allocation decisions, which will result in death rather than a drop in earnings.&#13;

One critical step in this process is the collection of a large set of sensor data that represents both healthy and faulty operations, collected under different operating conditions. By doing so, the ML model will be better equipped to detect faults more effectively and accurately.&#13;
&#13;
In some cases, there may not be enough data available to represent a healthy and faulty machine. To overcome this, a mathematical model of the machine can be built and its parameters estimated based on the sensor data. This digital twin model can then be used to simulate the real-world system to model the reliability of the machine under different fault states and operating conditions.&#13;
&#13;
By following a robust workflow, companies can develop ML models that can detect faults more effectively, leading to better outcomes, increased efficiency, and cost savings.&#13;

&#13;
Even the most robust supply chain has a few weak links. Maybe yours are concentrated upstream, with small manufacturers that suffer from quality-control issues, or downstream, with retailers that have trouble getting products into customers’ hands-on time. Either way, you may be able to bolster those links—or forge some alternatives—with the help of additive manufacturing.&#13;
&#13;
Consider an industrial product manufacturer with a customer who needs a particular low-demand service part immediately, and can’t wait for shipping from a central warehouse or, worse, for fabrication by some remote supplier. If a dealer could simply “print” a new component on the spot, that customer could be served far more efficiently and effectively.&#13;
&#13;
Or think of what now happens when an obscure machine part breaks at a remotely located factory: While waiting for trains and trucks to deliver a replacement, operations leadership must devise workarounds or let the shop floor sit idle. An on-site 3D printer might fabricate a new part and enable barely a pause in productivity—potentially saving thousands or tens of thousands of dollars per hour in facility downtime and the company's credibility.&#13;
&#13;
⚡Using additive manufacturing technologies to evolve supply chains can offer companies substantial value and competitive advantage. Some potential benefits could be from lowering costs and risks to greater flexibility and agility.&#13;

It promises to bring significant benefits for companies, such as increased productivity, quality, flexibility and customer satisfaction.&#13;
&#13;
However, implementing Industry 4.0 is not a simple task. It requires a holistic approach that considers not only the technical aspects but also the strategic, organizational and cultural aspects of digital transformation. A 2021 survey conducted by the Roland Berger consulting firm revealed that many companies are still struggling to realize the full potential of Industry 4.0. Not much change in the past year as well.&#13;
&#13;
The survey found that only 16% of the respondents have a clear vision and roadmap for their digital transformation, while 84% lack a coherent strategy or have no strategy at all. Moreover, only 18% of the respondents have achieved a high level of digital maturity across their entire value chain, while 82% have low or medium levels of maturity.&#13;
&#13;
The survey also identified four key success factors for achieving Industry 4.0:&#13;
&#13;
• A clear vision and roadmap that aligns with the company's overall strategy and goals&#13;
• A strong leadership commitment and sponsorship drive the change process&#13;
• A cross-functional collaboration and empowerment that fosters innovation and agility&#13;
• A continuous learning and improvement culture that enables adaptation and scalability&#13;
&#13;
By following these success factors, companies can overcome the challenges and barriers that hinder their digital transformation and unlock the full potential of Industry 4.0.&#13;

&#13;
The right applications of technology can lead to more empowered decision-making; new opportunities for upskilling, reskilling, and cross-functional collaboration; better talent attraction and retention; and improved workplace safety and employee satisfaction.&#13;
&#13;
Customers see the impacts through reduced manufacturing lead times, right-first time launch management, and improved customer service and complexity management. And, of course, there are the win–win advantages associated with reduced environmental impact, made possible through lower emissions and reduced waste and more efficient energy, water, and raw-material consumption.&#13;
&#13;
These productivity, process, and people improvements are not easy to accomplish—especially across a network of individual manufacturing sites, each with its own site leadership, IT infrastructure, and workplace culture. It is not uncommon to hear of companies achieving impressive results through pilot programs at one factory site only to find themselves unable to replicate these local wins across their network.&#13;
&#13;
The digitally enabled factory of today looks very different from the leading factory of ten years ago. Advances in data and analytics, AI, and ML—and the array of technology vendors in the market—mean manufacturers can choose from hundreds of potential solutions and tech applications to improve their ways of working.&#13;
&#13;
Implemented successfully, these solutions deliver irresistible returns.&#13;

&#13;
While each of these technologies is at a different stage of development, the extent to which they complement and enable one another holds possible implications for their ability to attract future investments.&#13;
&#13;
Firms can invest in AI solutions but need data to make AI function. Digital data isn’t exactly physical, but it doesn’t exist in the ether either — it needs a physical storage place. For the sake of cost and convenience, most firms have decided that at least some of that storage place should exist in the cloud. Companies don’t just need raw data, they need data that has been organised, categorised and analysed. And all of this new digital scaffolding needs to be protected. As more and more digital technology is adopted, there will inevitably be greater investment in #cybersecurity. &#13;

Low-code or no-code technologies will account for 70% of new applications developed by organizations by 2025, compared to less than 25% in 2020. Low-code application platforms will boost citizen development, and empower business technologists who work outside of IT departments and deliver technology or analytics solutions for internal or external business use.&#13;

&#13;
Decision Intelligence is the most advanced result of Artificial Intelligence techniques applied to risk mitigation processes and the achievement of objectives&#13;
&#13;
📈 Maintenance now plays a central role in the management of complex machines and systems. In modern plants, it is in fact increasingly important to guarantee pre-established levels of productivity and availability also in consideration of the fact that these are often parameters included in the contractual terms.&#13;
&#13;
💡 Industry 4.0 and Artificial Intelligence are making a truly significant contribution to the evolution of maintenance, which has gone from a purely reactive operation to a preventive, predictive and finally prescriptive operation. This evolution is fundamental for identifying and controlling the risks associated with the operational life cycle of complex systems by organizations, both in terms of magnitude and frequency of unwanted events. And it is precisely in this context that the new machine learning techniques of Industry 4.0, based on Artificial Intelligence, can represent a valuable tool for automating the analysis of large amounts of data from plants and machinery and for prevention of associated risks.&#13;
&#13;
🎯 This new approach to maintenance, which represents the most modern evolution of predictive maintenance, offers the opportunity not only to predict the onset of problems and failures but also to prescribe solutions and provide decision support, identifying actions to be undertaken and selecting the optimal risk management policy in terms of safety, availability, profitability and sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
Prescriptive maintenance, therefore, makes it possible to simulate alternative scenarios on the basis of certain actions and to evaluate their impact both from a financial and safety point of view, along different time horizons and under certain conditions. In this way, it is possible to calibrate decisions such as the decommissioning of a specific structure, the replacement of a system to reach the end of life, the remodelling of the amortization plan and the revision of some items of the income statement. Thanks to the possibility of making inferences, that is to draw deductive conclusions, supported by Artificial Intelligence in a decision-making network, Decision Intelligence also allows for the evaluation of the possible impacts of simulations including the "Life cycle assessment" and the "life cycle cost". &#13;

&#13;
&#13;
With so much at stake to build digital capabilities that drive customer centricity and productivity, why do so many companies fail? And not just troubled companies—top performers, market leaders, and investor favourites, too. Research by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) shows that 70% of digital transformations fall short of their objectives, often with profound consequences.&#13;
&#13;
📈Digital leaders achieve earnings growth that is 1.8 times higher than digital laggards—and more than double the growth in total enterprise value. In the short term, digital technologies and working methods offer productivity improvements and better customer experiences. In the medium term, digital opens up new growth opportunities and business model innovation. Successful transformations also set companies up for sustained success; they won’t have to digitally transform again as they master continuous innovation. Investors say that 50% of companies should invest more aggressively in digital capabilities and technology.&#13;
&#13;
But there is a conundrum for management: digital transformations are difficult to execute. And with so much on the line, only 30% of transformations succeed in achieving their objectives. There are good reasons for this, too. Technology is important, but the people dimension (organization, operating model, processes, and culture) is usually the determining factor. Organizational inertia from deeply rooted behaviours is a big impediment.&#13;
&#13;
Failure should not be an option, and yet it is the most common result. The consequences in terms of investments of money, organizational effort, and elapsed time are massive. Digital laggards fall behind in customer engagement, process efficiency, and innovation.&#13;
&#13;
When trying to bring everyone along with the overall plan, it can be easy to compromise and lose focus on the transformational aspiration. This is where the trouble usually starts. But among all the decisions that must be made, six critical success factors stand out. The companies that get these six factors right flip their odds of success from 30% to 80%.&#13;
&#13;
🎯The six essential success factors are:&#13;
&#13;
1. An Integrated Strategy with Clear Transformation Goals. &#13;
2. Leadership Commitment from CEO Through Middle Management. &#13;
3. Deploying High-Calibre Talent.&#13;
4. An Agile Governance Mindset That Drives Broader Adoption. &#13;
5. Effective Monitoring of Progress Toward Defined Outcomes. &#13;
6. Business-Led Modular Technology and Data Platform.&#13;

While other industries have captured the impact of digitalized documentation, shipping is only beginning to make progress.&#13;
&#13;
The digitalization of trade documentation may be considered to be a mundane task, but the impact it could deliver would be significant. Various international bodies have estimated the effect that digitalization would have on global trade. The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) projects that paperless trade could create $267 billion of additional exports across G7 countries, compared to base forecasts, by 2026.&#13;
&#13;
The World Trade Organization reports that implementing the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) could 𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗱𝗲 𝗯𝘆 𝗯𝗲𝘁𝘄𝗲𝗲𝗻 $𝟳𝟱𝟬 𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 $𝟭 𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗮 𝘆𝗲𝗮𝗿. The TFA aims to reduce the trade costs of import and export activities and accelerate the clearance of goods by setting digitalization standards such as electronic data submission between agencies and the use of digital signatures. Implementing the TFA would likely produce wide-ranging economic benefits, especially in emerging and developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
The ICC notes that the use of paper-based processes places an extraordinary burden on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) seeking to trade internationally—and digitalization would help close this trade finance gap. According to the World Economic Forum, the current trade finance gap, or the amount of requested trade finance that is rejected, is estimated at $1.5 trillion globally, with 𝗦𝗠𝗘𝘀 𝘀𝘂𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗺𝗼𝘀𝘁!&#13;

By reinventing the organization!&#13;
&#13;
The management concepts that the org chart visualizes—coordination, hierarchy, a matrixed organization—are the one's leaders grew up with and know best, as did generations before them. The original org chart hailed from 1854 and was introduced to help run the New York and Erie Railroad during the age of the steam locomotive.&#13;
&#13;
Therein lies the challenge. Today’s organizations are set up as traditional hierarchies or matrix organizations with roots stretching back to the industrial revolutions of the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. In theory, these structures provide clear lines of authority from frontline employees up through layers of management. In reality, matrix structures have only grown more complex as the business has—to the extent that in some companies they are so cumbersome they hardly function.&#13;

To effectively lead and navigate change, it is important to acknowledge both the psychological and structural aspects of change. This includes embracing feelings of surprise, shock, hope, and doubt as integral to the process. It is also essential to recognize that change can arise from situational, developmental, or volitional sources and to discern the differences in these drivers for each situation.&#13;
&#13;
Engaging and empowering your team is critical to achieving successful change. This involves actively involving them in understanding and recognizing the need for change through system needs scans, stakeholder mapping, and discovery interviews. Remember, effective change requires collaboration and teamwork.&#13;
&#13;
The change process is not linear and can vary depending on the organization and its complexities. Wendling and Sibbet's "The Seven Challenges of Change Framework" is a valuable tool that can guide leaders towards a comprehensive understanding of the change process.&#13;

Does a human driver need to be ready to take over? Can it drive on its own all or just some of the time? And do driving conditions need to be ideal or can it handle the odd thunderstorm?&#13;
&#13;
Fortunately, SAE International, the global standards and engineering association, has come up with the creatively named “Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On-Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems,” or SAE JS3016 for short.&#13;
&#13;
The system has six levels of automation and spans a yawning gulf of features. Level zero is analogous to Fred Flintstone’s foot-powered, stone-age car, while level five is something like George Jetson’s futuristic, bubble-blowing flying saucer.&#13;
&#13;
𝗟𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹 𝟬: 𝗡𝗼 𝗗𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻&#13;
The driver is in full control and there is no automation technology. It may include support or alert systems such as stability control and blind-spot warning. Most cars on the road today are level zero.&#13;
&#13;
𝗟𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹 𝟭: 𝗗𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲&#13;
The driver is supported by one support system, like adaptive cruise control or lane-following assistance, but needs to be ready to take control at any time.&#13;
&#13;
𝗟𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹 𝟮: 𝗣𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗗𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻&#13;
The driver still needs to be alert and supervise at all times, but the vehicle can take over multiple functions like braking, acceleration, and steering, using Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS). The Tesla Autopilot feature is generally understood to fall under level two.&#13;
&#13;
𝗟𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹 𝟯: 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗱𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗗𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻&#13;
After this point, you are not considered to be driving, even if you’re seated in the driver’s seat. Using artificial intelligence (AI), the vehicle handles all driving tasks. A driver still needs to be present in case of an emergency or system failure. Honda’s Traffic Jam Pilot and Mercedes-Benz’s Drive Pilot are the only ones to hit this milestone.&#13;
&#13;
𝗟𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹 𝟰: 𝗛𝗶𝗴𝗵 𝗗𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻&#13;
This is where you lose the steering wheel and pedals. A level four vehicle is completely autonomous but is limited by speed or to a certain geographic area. In the event of a system failure or emergency, the vehicle can slow down, pull over, and stop on its own. A driverless taxi or public transport would be a likely application at this level.&#13;
&#13;
𝗟𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹 𝟱: 𝗙𝘂𝗹𝗹 𝗗𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻&#13;
This is the Holy Grail of automated vehicles. At this level, humans are completely superfluous and need only set the destination and sit back and enjoy the ride. The vehicle can drive in any situation, in all conditions, and is not limited to a particular location or speed.&#13;

&#13;
Think about it. 💡&#13;
&#13;
Despite 89% of large companies embarking on digital and AI transformations, they're only seeing 31% of the anticipated revenue boost and 25% of the cost savings.&#13;
&#13;
The real challenge lies in convincing business leaders of the tangible benefits and guiding them on the path to success. Without this conviction and guidance, the necessary deep-rooted changes often remain unimplemented.&#13;
&#13;
Intriguingly, a study observing 80 global banks from 2018 to 2022 across 50 metrics, including digital/mobile usage, digital product sales, contact centre staffing, and branch numbers, highlighted a significant finding.&#13;
&#13;
📌 It revealed that digital frontrunners are generating substantially more value for shareholders, setting a high bar for competitors by creating hard-to-replicate value.&#13;

&#13;
The ecosystem accounts for 13 percent of global GDP, but construction has seen a meager productivity growth of 1 percent annually for the past two decades. Time and cost overruns are the norm, and overall earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) are only around 5 percent despite the presence of significant risk in the industry. &#13;
&#13;
Nine shifts will radically change the way construction projects are delivered—and similar industries have already undergone many of the shifts. A combination of sustainability requirements, cost pressure, skills scarcity, new materials, industrial approaches, digitalization, and a new breed of player looks set to transform the value chain. The shifts ahead include productization and specialization, increased value-chain control, and greater customer- centricity and branding. &#13;
&#13;
Consolidation and internationalization will create the scale needed to allow higher levels of investment in digitalization, R&amp;D and equipment, and sustainability as well as human capital. &#13;
&#13;
The construction industry needs to evolve from its traditional, manual processes to more sophisticated operations that leverage modern technologies and management approaches. Construction is no longer just about building unique structures and physical infrastructure. It needs to embrace the opportunities already introduced and proven in Industry 4.0.&#13;

&#13;
Industry clouds create value for organizations by incorporating cloud services traditionally purchased separately into preintegrated but customizable (composable) industry-relevant solutions. As such, they can increase organizational agility, speed innovation and accelerate time to value.&#13;
&#13;
Industry cloud platforms enable a shift from generic solutions to platforms designed to fit the specifics of the user’s industry.&#13;
&#13;
Industry cloud platforms combine software, platform and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) with tailored, industry-specific functionality that can more easily adapt to the relentless stream of disruptions in their industry.&#13;
&#13;

Mining equipment needs to work in challenging environments, for example. Power plants face tough operating regimes. The refining and chemicals sectors must process demanding materials. These conditions put machines under stress, and the high preventive and reactive maintenance expenditures needed to keep them healthy can be a drain on profitability.&#13;

&#13;
As a result, analytics tools have grown in importance. Manufacturers can gain greater, more timely insights with analytics at the edge and in the cloud, allowing them to improve operational performance and, as a result, increase revenue and margins.&#13;
&#13;
A manufacturer can develop additional, pertinent service offerings for each customer with more insight into the products installed at their sites, such as maintenance contracts that allow the manufacturer to monitor customers' equipment and guarantee it is always operating at peak efficiency. For the manufacturer, this means additional revenue streams. The manufacturer also avoids the need—and related expense—for equipment covered by a warranty to be shipped to a facility for repair by using this equipment data to proactively identify and fix potential issues before they become problems. As a result, fewer warranty claims affect the company's bottom line.&#13;
&#13;
Paradoxically, the main obstacle to using analytics in manufacturing is also its opportunity: the need for proof of value. We observe that businesses frequently start with proofs of concept and precise analytics applications, i.e., the areas where the opportunity is most naturally apparent.&#13;
&#13;
Security issues represent another barrier. Protecting those capabilities and limiting access to the underlying data related to them are essential for sectors like high tech, where intellectual property (IP) related to manufacturing capability and process design is essential to success.&#13;
&#13;
Additionally, there are obstacles caused by disconnected systems and a limited or non-existent flow of structured data within systems. The skills people have to use these new tools—which are frequently lacking or need to be strengthened—and their willingness to adopt new technology are the most frequent risks or barriers.&#13;

Agile businesses, particularly start-ups, seem to turn on a dime and don't appear to have any kind of plan. It's easy to believe that what you see an agile firm doing - acting quickly, maintaining a high tempo, and being highly responsive - is all there is.&#13;
&#13;
𝘞𝘩𝘺 𝘪𝘵’𝘴 𝘸𝘳𝘰𝘯𝘨&#13;
It is not a strategy to be agile. It is a capability, although a very valuable one with immediate operational benefits, it cannot permanently affect a firm's competitive position unless the right decisions are made about where to direct that capability. And the apparent lack of a plan does not imply that successful start-ups lack strategies. A strategy is not a plan; it is a decision-making framework, a set of guiding principles that can be applied as the situation evolves. Most businesses fail because being able to turn on a dime does not guarantee that you will turn in the right direction. Successful start-ups spend a lot of time debating fundamentals and asking tough questions.&#13;
&#13;
Successful start-ups do a lot of hard thinking about fundamentals, questioning and testing basic assumptions with the rigour that incumbents would do well to imitate. Start-ups must do so because their resources are extremely limited. If they do not have a coherent strategy, they will make poor resource allocation decisions, which will result in death rather than a drop in earnings.&#13;

This is similar to how the steam age or the electric age (the first and second industrial revolutions, respectively) brought about radical improvements in efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
McKinsey estimates that IoT applications in factory settings could generate a value of $𝟭.𝟮 𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗼 $𝟯.𝟳 𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗽𝗲𝗿 𝘆𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝗯𝘆 𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟱. Their research suggests that the largest value creation opportunity will be in operations optimization—enhancing the performance of various processes within the factory. This includes using sensors, instead of human intervention (and human error), to fine-tune the operation of machinery. It also involves using data from production equipment to optimize workflows. This is achieved by remotely tracking, monitoring, and adjusting machines, based on sensor data from different parts of the plant (and even across plants).&#13;
&#13;
Overall, IoT applications in operations optimization could create a value of $633 billion to $1.8 trillion per year in the factory setting by 2025.&#13;
&#13;
Besides operations optimization, the other major value drivers of IoT in the factory setting are predictive maintenance and inventory optimization. Predictive maintenance uses sensors to continuously observe machinery to prevent failures and determine when maintenance is needed, rather than relying on fixed maintenance schedules. IoT can improve inventory management by automatically replenishing parts bins based on weight or height data captured by sensors. &#13;

These tools have become increasingly more powerful, flexible, and sophisticated since the 1960s and 1970s when computers first began replacing drawing boards in design offices. Today, 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲𝗰𝘆𝗰𝗹𝗲 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 (𝗣𝗟𝗠) has become engineers’ first language: PLM systems help companies to capture, codify, process, and communicate product knowledge across their organizations.&#13;
&#13;
Yet as engineering tools have become more capable, the demands placed upon them have also increased. Product functions are increasingly delivered through a combination of hardware and software. Sensors and communications capabilities allow products to offer more features and to respond more effectively to changing operating conditions and user requirements. Advanced, adaptable user interfaces have simplified the operation of complex and sophisticated machines.&#13;
&#13;
Evolving business models are also blurring the boundaries between design and use. Customers expect the performance and functionality of products to improve during their life cycle, enabled by over-the-air software updates or the ability to unlock new features as needed. Many products operate as part of an ecosystem of related products and services. Increasingly, customers are not buying products outright, but paying for the capabilities they provide on a per-use or subscription basis.&#13;
&#13;
⚡These changing requirements have triggered a transformation in digital product representation and the creation of a new tool: 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗱𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝘄𝗶𝗻. Digital twins combine and build upon existing digital engineering tools, incorporating additional data sources, adding advanced simulation and analytics capabilities, and establishing links to live data generated during the product’s manufacture and use. A conventional PLM system uses one digital model to represent each variant of a product. A digital twin, by contrast, may have one model for each individual product, which is continually updated using data collected during the product’s life cycle.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
AM has four general environmental advantages over conventional or subtractive manufacturing: &#13;
• material efficiency, &#13;
• resource efficiency, &#13;
• production flexibility and &#13;
• part flexibility. &#13;
&#13;
Unlike subtractive manufacturing in which waste material is removed to reveal a product, AM only creates what is needed for the product with minimal support structure. Resource efficiencies refer to how generally simplistic AM machines are. Conventional machinery often requires auxiliary tools, equipment and coolants, which utilize energy and generate emissions and waste. Because AM has less need for ancillary equipment than do conventional machines, AM requires fewer resources, and therefore has fewer energy needs. Also, because these ancillary tools and equipment are not needed for production, parts can be made by smaller manufacturers located closer to users, thus reducing transportation costs and related emissions. Part flexibility is a major waste reduction aspect of AM. The ability to make on-demand products reduces inventory and other wastes. Finally, production flexibility, or the ability to quickly switch between different products without costly or time-consuming setup, allows a more streamlined supply chain and economical production batches to meet customer needs. &#13;
&#13;
One significant way that AM reduces waste in the manufacturing industry is by the inherent made-to-order technology. Inventory waste reduction and fewer unsold products can be taken advantage of due to small-batch orders and only producing as many items as are requested. Companies have capitalized on making spare parts with the made-to-order technology, and can generate less high-value waste. In fact, it is estimated that up to $370 billion in savings will occur by 2025 from the reduction of input material and a shorter supply chain (Ford &amp; Despeisse, 2016).&#13;
&#13;
Do you use AM in your company? Pyron Technology can support you with decision on AM implementation and best usage.&#13;

&#13;
AM offers four main environmental advantages over subtractive manufacturing techniques: &#13;
1. material efficiency, &#13;
2. resource efficiency, &#13;
3. production flexibility, and &#13;
4. part flexibility. &#13;
&#13;
Unlike subtractive manufacturing, which involves removing waste material to create a product, AM only uses the necessary materials and requires minimal support structures. &#13;
&#13;
AM machines are generally simpler than conventional machinery and require fewer auxiliary tools, equipment, and coolants that consume energy and generate waste and emissions. As a result, AM requires fewer resources and less energy than conventional manufacturing methods. Also, because AM doesn't require auxiliary tools and equipment, small-scale manufacturers can produce parts closer to their users, reducing transportation costs and associated emissions. &#13;
&#13;
The ability to create products on demand reduces inventory and waste, while production flexibility enables a more streamlined supply chain and allows for economical production batches that meet customer needs. &#13;
&#13;
One of the most significant ways that AM helps to reduce waste in the manufacturing industry is through its made-to-order technology. By producing only the quantity of items that are requested, companies can avoid excess inventory and unsold products, resulting in less waste. 𝗦𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘀 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗮𝗹𝘀𝗼 𝗯𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝗲𝗱 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗔𝗠'𝘀 𝗺𝗮𝗱𝗲-𝘁𝗼-𝗼𝗿𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝘆, 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗵𝗶𝗴𝗵-𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗲 𝘄𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲. &#13;
&#13;
It's estimated that by 2025, the reduction of input materials and a shorter supply chain could result in up to $370 billion in savings. &#13;
&#13;
If you're interested in using AM in your company, Pyron Technology can help you make informed decisions about AM implementation and usage. &#13;

Do you have them and how can you improve them?&#13;
&#13;
The most in-demand managerial abilities are those that include strategic thinking. Why? Because the direction of a firm can be significantly impacted by workers capable of critical, rational, and strategic thought.&#13;
&#13;
❗The good news is that you can develop your strategic thinking abilities with the appropriate attitude and practice.&#13;
&#13;
⚡Any abilities that help you apply critical thinking to solve complicated problems and make plans are considered strategic thinking abilities. These abilities are necessary to attain professional goals, overcome roadblocks, and deal with hurdles, especially if they are anticipated to take weeks, months, or even years to complete.&#13;
&#13;
Strategic thinking skills include:&#13;
1. Analytical skills&#13;
2. Communication skills&#13;
3. Problem-solving skills&#13;
4. Planning and management skills &#13;
&#13;
𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝘁𝗼 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀?&#13;
One of the simplest things you can do to develop your strategic thinking abilities is to 𝗮𝘀𝗸 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗶𝗰 𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀. By doing this, you may practise your planning abilities, improve your ability to see opportunities and cultivate a more strategic attitude that you can use throughout your career.&#13;
&#13;
You need to intelligently respond to and deal with them. One of the best methods to do this is to 𝗼𝗯𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗿𝗲𝗳𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁 on your current circumstance, ensuring that any strategy you come up with is supported by data.&#13;
&#13;
Once you've chosen a course of action that will enable your company to achieve its objectives, 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘂𝗺𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗽𝘂𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗵𝘆𝗽𝗼𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗮 𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵 𝘁𝗲𝘀𝘁. You can make sure you're not skipping over another option by doing this.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Design thinking is an innovative problem-solving process rooted in a set of skills. The approach has been around for decades.&#13;
&#13;
At a high level, the steps involved in the design thinking process are simple: first, fully understand the problem; second, explore a wide range of possible solutions; third, iterate extensively through prototyping and testing; and finally, implement through the customary deployment mechanisms. &#13;
&#13;
The skills associated with these steps help people apply creativity to effectively solve real-world problems better than they otherwise would. They can be readily learned, but take effort. &#13;
&#13;
Creative brainstorming is necessary for developing possible solutions, but many people don’t do it particularly well. And throughout the process it is critical to engage in modelling, analysis, prototyping, and testing, and to really learn from these many iterations.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
With all the hype around blockchain, it can be hard to nail down the facts. Blockchain is a distributed ledger, or database, shared across a public or private computing network. Each computer node in the network holds a copy of the ledger, so there is no single point of failure. Every piece of information is mathematically encrypted and added as a new “block” to the chain of historical records. Various consensus protocols are used to validate a new block with other participants before it can be added to the chain. This prevents fraud or double spending without requiring a central authority. The ledger can also be programmed with “smart contracts,” a set of conditions recorded on the blockchain so that transactions automatically trigger when the conditions are met. For example, smart contracts could be used to automate insurance-claim payouts.&#13;
&#13;
The potential for blockchain to become a new open-standard protocol for trusted records, identity, and transactions cannot be simply dismissed. Blockchain technology can solve the need for an entity to be in charge of managing, storing, and funding a database. True peer-to-peer models can become commercially viable due to blockchain’s ability to compensate participants for their contributions with “tokens” (application-specific cryptoassets) as well as give them a stake in any future increases in the value. However, the mentality shift required and the commercial disruption such a model would entail are immense.&#13;
&#13;
Blockchain might have the disruptive potential to be the basis of new operating models, but its initial impact will be to drive operational efficiencies. Cost can be taken out of existing processes by removing intermediaries or the administrative effort of record keeping and transaction reconciliation. This can shift the flow of value by capturing lost revenues and creating new revenues for blockchain-service providers. Based on McKinsey &amp; Company's quantification of the monetary impact of the more than 90 use cases analysed, it is estimated that approximately 70% of the value at stake in the short term is in cost reduction, followed by revenue generation and capital relief.&#13;

&#13;
Strategy can quickly become out of date in an increasingly volatile and uncertain world. Strategic planning must be adaptive in order to address this challenge. The more adaptive your strategy models must be, the faster the rate of change in operating conditions and the more disruptions you must integrate into a long-term strategy.&#13;
&#13;
An adaptive strategy approach ensures that your organisation can spot new opportunities earlier and respond faster than competitors, increasing your chances of success in a dynamic digital world.&#13;
&#13;
A truly adaptive strategy approach adheres to four core practices that are intended to transition the enterprise from a rigid, top-down, calendar-based process to a more event-driven strategy approach. The same principles can be applied to functional strategy. While a truly adaptive approach will incorporate all four core practises, functional leaders can begin by concentrating on the practises that address their immediate strategy challenges.&#13;
&#13;
Rather than requiring perfect or complete information to execute, the adaptive strategy makes use of available data to identify immediate actions needed for an enterprise or function to succeed. These actions could include focusing on high-priority areas, making foundational investments, or running experiments to test ideas. You can use the insights gained from these actions, as well as any new information or analysis, to determine your next set of actions.&#13;
&#13;
Because adaptive strategy necessitates reviewing strategy whenever new (and relevant) information becomes available, it's critical to constantly scan the business context for changes and review — and, if necessary, adjust — strategy in response to changes.&#13;

&#13;
Leaders tend to adopt innovative technology sooner and reinvest more frequently. They make smarter tech investment decisions. And they direct their IT budget toward innovation.&#13;
&#13;
When the pandemic began, Leaders scaled their investments in key technologies such as cloud and AI. This helped them absorb impacts quickly and refocus on growth.&#13;
&#13;
In sharp contrast, many Laggards invested in newer technologies for the first time just to keep their companies operational. &#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Leapfroggers are the ones to watch. They are overtaking peers and catching up with Leaders.&#13;
&#13;
What makes a Leapfrogger? It seems it is a combinatorial effect of two factors:&#13;
&#13;
1. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗽𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗴𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝗰𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗦𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺𝘀 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗴𝘁𝗵 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝗹𝗼𝘂𝗱.&#13;

   In contrast to the 30% share we usually see spent on innovation and the 70% spent on maintenance and operations, they reverse that split entirely.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Companies across the globe see and act upon the need for compressed transformation to remain relevant while becoming more resilient and responsible. This includes the transformation of a core piece of their business – manufacturing. Three burning platforms are driving them toward the next digital frontier:&#13;
1. The ongoing pandemic is accelerating change. &#13;
2. Software redefines physical products. &#13;
3. The sustainability imperative depends on digital.&#13;
&#13;
All three developments are landmarks of the next digital frontier ahead for most manufacturers. They pose significant challenges to how customer and employee-relevant manufacturers will remain, how resilient they will be and how responsibly they can act. &#13;
&#13;
🎯The technologies are available and have proven their worth and both the need and the benefits of digital manufacturing are obvious. Companies that connect technology intelligently and manage the change it brings wisely can go well beyond the efficiency and effectiveness scenarios that Industry 4.0 provides.&#13;
&#13;
Pyron Technology can support your efforts on this journey. &#13;

 &#13;
Are you in a position of leadership in your organization? Is your company currently in the process of implementing a transformative business strategy? How assured are you of the efficacy of this plan?&#13;
 &#13;
The art of strategy is a complex and nuanced discipline that requires careful consideration of a variety of factors. It is not simply a matter of making decisions based on a pre-determined list of options, nor is it about blindly pursuing a single goal at the expense of all other considerations.&#13;
 &#13;
Instead, the art of strategy involves a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities facing an organization, as well as the ability to navigate the complex web of relationships and competing interests that exist within it.&#13;
 &#13;
📌 It requires creativity, flexibility, and a willingness to challenge conventional thinking in order to find new and innovative solutions to the problems at hand. Ultimately, the art of strategy is about achieving long-term success by balancing the needs and aspirations of all stakeholders, and by constantly adapting to changing circumstances and evolving market conditions.&#13;
 &#13;
✔ To create a strategy, one needs to embrace the full complex and confusing force of the challenges and opportunities being faced.&#13;
 &#13;
✔ To create a strategy, one has to develop a sense for the crux of the problem—the place where a commitment to action will have the best chance of surmounting the most critical obstacles.&#13;
 &#13;
✔ To create a strategy, one needs to be persistent and avoid the temptation to grab the first glimmer of a pathway through the thicket of issues.&#13;
 &#13;
✔ To create a strategy, one must balance a host of issues with its bundle of accompanying ambitions—the purposes, values, and beliefs that stakeholders wish to support.&#13;
 &#13;
✔ To create a strategy, one must keep actions and policies coherent and aligned, instead of nullifying efforts by pursuing too many different initiatives or conflicting purposes.&#13;
 &#13;
These facts are rarely written or spoken about with honesty. We are told that strategy is about having an advantage —that it is about having a long-term vision of where you want to be. We are told that by adopting method X or mindset Y the average business can become as successful as the very best.&#13;
 &#13;
📌 So, don’t start with goals—start by understanding the challenge and finding its crux.&#13;

Companies are rapidly investing in technology, eager to adopt a digital-first approach and completely transform the way they operate. While the pandemic and supply chain issues have caused an increased focus on digital transformation, some businesses may be getting ahead of themselves and find their efforts to be fruitless. &#13;
&#13;
⚡Digital transformation is not a simple process that leads to immediate success. Companies can end up spending more time and money than anticipated without seeing the desired results. Instead of viewing digital transformation as a one-time project, businesses should consider it an ongoing mission that never truly ends. This way, companies can successfully move through the stages of digital transformation. &#13;
&#13;
For digital transformation to be successful, there are several other factors to consider. Companies should keep the idea of an ever-evolving mission in mind and focus on taking their digital transformation to the next level. &#13;

The key differences that define your data's value.&#13;
&#13;
A data lake, as defined by Gartner, is a treasure trove of raw, unstructured data.&#13;
↳ Think of it as a well-organized library where every book has a code.&#13;
&#13;
A data swamp is what happens when the library gets disorganized.&#13;
↳ Imagine trying to find a book without a catalogue - pure chaos.&#13;
&#13;
Data lakes are searchable, thanks to metadata; swamps are not.&#13;
↳ Metadata is like a library's index card, guiding you to the right shelf.&#13;
&#13;
Lakes have data governance; swamps have data anarchy.&#13;
↳ Good governance in data is like having librarians who know exactly where each book belongs.&#13;
&#13;
Cleansing strategies keep lakes pristine; swamps are murky with errors.&#13;
↳ Without regular cleaning, even the best library turns into a garage sale.&#13;
&#13;
Organized, relevant data defines a lake; irrelevant clutter characterizes a swamp.&#13;
↳ A pristine lake is full of fish; a swamp is just... swampy.&#13;
&#13;
Governance is the dividing line - it ensures quality and relevance.&#13;
↳ Governance is the difference between a well-run library and a room full of old newspapers.&#13;
&#13;
Avoid transforming your data lake into a swamp:&#13;
&#13;
• Less is more. Focus on quality data, not quantity.&#13;
• Let automation handle the cleanup.&#13;
• Define the data's purpose early to streamline relevance.&#13;
&#13;
Remember, an ocean of data is useless if you can't navigate through it. Metadata is becoming easier to manage, so invest in it. &#13;
&#13;
📌 Your data strategy is as crucial as the data itself.&#13;
&#13;
In the end, a data lake is a source of truth, easily navigable; a data swamp is a maze of misinformation. &#13;
&#13;
Choose wisely, manage effectively, and let your data strategy reflect the clarity of a lake, not the confusion of a swamp.&#13;

The central bank says early results reveal some interesting trends falling across six policy areas.&#13;
&#13;
The survey found that almost all European institutions have a digital transformation strategy, typically consuming a fifth of the IT budget, although the degree of maturity differs. The main objectives are becoming more customer-centric in how products and services are offered as a lever to increasing revenues and improving operational efficiency by automating processes and modernising IT infrastructures.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
With limited resources at hand, companies need to stay smart and efficient when it comes to investing in innovation.&#13;
&#13;
This is a challenging time for many companies. On the one hand, supply chain disruption, labour shortage, raw material and energy price hikes are driving up business costs. On the other, demand is slack due to consumers’ reduced purchasing power and an uncertain global economic outlook. Together these conditions squeeze companies’ profits and cast a shadow on their #growth prospects. In this time of difficulty, executives around the world find it more urgent than ever to sharpen their organisations’ innovation #strategy to create new markets for growth.&#13;
&#13;
Economics has long taught us that R&amp;D and technology advances, as measured by R&amp;D spending and numbers of patents, are the central drivers of innovation and growth. But market creation for growth is not inevitably about technological innovation.&#13;
&#13;
With limited resources at hand, companies need to stay smart and efficient when it comes to investing in innovation. If technologies are involved, they should enable and facilitate the delivery of key buyer value elements, instead of making products or services too futuristic, esoteric or complicated for customers to adopt.&#13;
&#13;
Is your #innovation strategy anchored to #value?&#13;

&#13;
Predictive maintenance (PdM) is changing how industries approach maintenance. By predicting equipment failures before they happen, PdM is turning maintenance 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗯𝗲𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗰𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗰𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗮 𝘄𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗲.&#13;
&#13;
PdM is more than just fixing machines; it's about smart investment in technology that predicts equipment failures before they occur. This approach yields tangible financial benefits:&#13;
&#13;
• 𝗥𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗰𝗲𝗱 𝗖𝗼𝘀𝘁𝘀: Implementing PdM can lead to 12-18% cost reduction, compared to traditional maintenance methods (Brightly Software)​​. For industries like manufacturing, energy, and mining, these savings are substantial, considering the high cost of unplanned downtime.&#13;
  &#13;
• 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝗨𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗘𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆: Industries report 10-20% increased equipment uptime with PdM (Deloitte)​​. This means more productive hours and less time lost to breakdowns.&#13;
  &#13;
• 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗶𝗰 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲 𝗔𝗹𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Predictive Maintenance facilitates better inventory management and resource allocation. The data-driven approach leads to more accurate forecasting and utilization, reducing unnecessary expenses.&#13;
  &#13;
• 𝗟𝗼𝗻𝗴-𝗧𝗲𝗿𝗺 𝗥𝗢𝗜: The investment in PdM technology pays off in the long run. Businesses can expect savings of 18-25% in maintenance expenditures and additional benefits in increased uptime (ATS)​​.&#13;
  &#13;
• 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗘𝘅𝗰𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲: PdM is integral to achieving operational excellence. By embedding it into the wider digital ecosystem, organizations can ensure data-driven decisions and proactive maintenance strategies (McKinsey &amp; Company)​​.&#13;

These technologies, such as quantum computing and the metaverse, may shape the next era and counteract the potential slowdown of growth.&#13;
&#13;
 AI is a particularly noteworthy technology, with the potential to underpin a Fourth Industrial Revolution. In the past seven years, AI-based patent applications have grown at a rate of more than 75 per cent per year and the global pandemic has only accelerated its adoption. As such, these transversal technologies are poised to change the world and represent a major investment opportunity.&#13;

&#13;
Many companies have struggled to rein in their organization’s shadow IT—applications, such as spreadsheets and desktop databases, created and maintained by different parts of the business but without the IT department’s knowledge or engagement. Shadow IT represents a double-edged sword: these applications support critical business activities, and are likely to grow with the advent of modern and more robust cloud-based productivity tools; however, since shadow IT skirts the regular procurement, implementation, and governance processes, the applications can significantly increase an organization’s IT and security risks.&#13;
&#13;
As companies contemplate a path forward, it’s worth acknowledging two truths: shadow IT is essential for business operations, and talent capable of creating applications often resides outside the IT department. Organizations must embrace this reality to begin the journey to capture the enterprise’s full potential for digital value creation and capabilities.&#13;
&#13;
Most organizations have two distinct sources of enterprise applications. On the “shadow side,” business understanding is translated into digital solutions—usually on low-code/no-code (LC/NC) platforms such as Excel—lacking IT governance and a structured development process.&#13;
&#13;
A new and exciting world can exist when an organization’s IT function extends its software-development know-how to the “shadow side” by providing professional LC/NC platforms and embracing business developers. In this way, the IT department has a significant role in building out the organization’s IT ecosystem.&#13;

&#13;
Such a culture is required for the successful implementation of a Big Data strategy. According to this roadmap, the best way to get started with Big Data is to first understand what it is and what it can do for your organisation, and then work with a multidisciplinary team to develop Proof of Concepts. These initial Proof of Concepts are critical for your company's data-driven transformation and should be shared with all employees.&#13;
&#13;
Knowledgent's infographic below depicts five levels of Big Data maturity within an organisation. The first level is referred to as the Infancy phase, and it is the stage at which one begins to understand Big Data and develop Proof of Concepts. &#13;
&#13;
The second level they identified is the technical adoption phase, in which the company prepares to implement various Big Data technologies. These technologies, whether on-premises or in the cloud, will allow a company to develop new Proof of Concepts / products or Big Data services more quickly and effectively.&#13;
&#13;
An organisation enters level 3 of the Big Data maturity index once the IT department is capable of working with Big Data technologies and the business understands what Big Data can do for them. More in-depth analysis of structured and unstructured data available within the company will result in more insights and better decision-making.&#13;
&#13;
Level 4 is where Big Data analytics has become an integral part of the company's culture and has resulted in integrated predictive insights into business operations. This is the final level before becoming a fully data-driven organisation that operates as a "data service provider." Companies that have achieved level 5 of the Big Data maturity index have integrated Big Data analytics at all levels of their organisation, are truly data-driven, and can be considered 'data companies' regardless of the product or service they provide. Based on their Big Data insights, they will significantly outperform their competitors.&#13;
&#13;
⚡All businesses should strive for Big Data maturity level 5 because it will lead to better decision-making, better products, and better service.&#13;

𝗢𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗼𝘂𝘀? (a word made up by AI describing a blend of optimism and nervousness when beginning a new journey/project)&#13;
&#13;
Digital transformation is not a destination; it’s a permanent state of evolution. The point isn’t to become digital; it’s to generate value for the business. And that can only happen if CEOs act as digital guardians of their companies’ transformations, and are clear on how they can best effect the change that will embed digital DNA into their organizations. &#13;
&#13;
A crucial characteristic of successful digital CEOs is that they can step back far enough from their current business to reimagine where transformative — not incremental — value is possible.&#13;

&#13;
When a company’s transformation ambition is mismatched with its readiness, it is the CEO’s job to close that gap. But first, the CEO must assess the current level of organizational readiness for change. Organizational readiness spans four core dimensions that combine to determine the organization’s overall readiness:&#13;
&#13;
1. Leadership: CEOs need to ensure that their C-suite and other key executives are motivated and capable of executing the vision. &#13;
   &#13;
2. Culture: A significant potential barrier to readiness is the organization’s culture. &#13;
   &#13;
3. Structure: If the organization hopes to operate differently, it may need to organize differently.&#13;
   &#13;
4. Capabilities: CEOs also need to equip their organization with capabilities to harness digital for a superior capacity for change.&#13;

&#13;
Cloud adoption has rocketed as companies seek computing and storage resources that can be scaled up and down in response to changing business needs. But even given the cost and agility upsides to cloud, there’s rising interest in yet another deployment model — edge computing, which is computing that’s done at or near the source of the data. It can empower new use cases, especially the innovative artificial intelligence and machine learning applications that are critical to modern business success.&#13;
&#13;
The promise of the edge comes down to data, according to MIT Technology Review. Specifically, there is a need to gather, process, and analyse data closest to where it’s being generated, whether that’s on the factory floor, in an autonomous vehicle, or in a smart building system.&#13;
&#13;
The ability to run artificial intelligence models directly on data at the edge without the extra step of moving workloads to the cloud reduces latency and costs.&#13;

According to Accenture, data-driven companies are propelled by four key drivers. They:&#13;
&#13;
1) Establish a solid data foundation: Achieved through an agile data supply chain with cloud-based and scalable platforms. &#13;
&#13;
2) Ensure data is secure, relevant and trustworthy: Accomplished through robust data governance, metadata management and data veracity solutions. This is enabled by machine learning (ML) or artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, right people structures and processes. Only a third of firms trusted their data enough to use it effectively and derive value from it.&#13;
&#13;
3) Create an analytics strategy: Attained by focusing on augmenting human efforts with AI and by building capabilities in advanced analytics. Almost 90 per cent of data-driven champions in the survey could attest to being highly involved in data analytics processes and automated approaches as opposed to 54 per cent of others.&#13;
&#13;
4) Envision and launch new data-driven services: Realized through innovative business models and operational efficiency measures. Using a data value scorecard, business outcomes can be measured, tracked and reported effectively.&#13;

&#13;
Despite some success in adopting digital technologies — and plans to invest in areas that are lagging — many manufacturers are encountering systemic obstacles and other challenges in getting the most out of digitizing the supply chain. For example, few tools yield “out of the box” benefits, requiring more time and digital know-how to make an impact, which should be considered in the business case. &#13;
&#13;
As per PwC's report, nearly half (47%) cite budget constraints as the top challenge of digitizing their supply chains, followed by insufficient capabilities of supply chain hardware and software systems (31%) and a misalignment of supply chain goals and the business’ overall strategic goals (31%).&#13;

&#13;
But there are also many other scenarios where digital twins are used as a way to measure and improve the performance of an existing product.&#13;
&#13;
A digital twin is a virtual representation that serves as the real-time digital counterpart of a physical object or process. The virtual twin is disrupting the entire product lifecycle management (PLM), from design to manufacturing to service and operations. The logic behind this is that any time there is a link between physical objects and processes, the potential for performance improvement exists.&#13;
&#13;
Digital twins can provide enterprises with cost benefits by &#13;
• reducing machine downtime, &#13;
• decreasing inventory holding costs,&#13;
• improving efficiency, &#13;
• increasing quality, &#13;
• empowering customers, &#13;
• saving space, &#13;
• improving productivity, &#13;
• saving energy, &#13;
• improving process automation, &#13;
• expanding market reach by providing more value for customers at lower costs than traditional solutions such as paper-based records which consume up to 80% of all energy produced during their production cycle; &#13;
• lowering purchase price tags by enabling smaller organizations to deal primarily with small volumes.&#13;

Let's discuss the best strategies for your organization.&#13;
&#13;
Change is a personal journey, and in the realm of digital transformation, it's paramount to recognize this. The success of organizational transformation hinges on widespread acceptance, no matter how optimal your solution might be.&#13;
&#13;
How to navigate the crucial aspects of stakeholder management?&#13;
&#13;
1. Assess Change: Start by grasping the full extent of the transformation. Understand its nature, assess risks, and consider change saturation. Remember, alignment with your strategic vision is key.&#13;
   &#13;
2. Identify Stakeholders: Navigate your organization systematically. Identify leaders in each group - their commitment can significantly influence others.&#13;
   &#13;
3. Understand Needs: Map the impact of the transformation beyond technology. Consider behaviour, responsibilities, and compensation changes. Proactively manage the supporters and opposers of change.&#13;
   &#13;
4. Involve Stakeholders: Collaboration is crucial. Develop leadership and people manager engagement plans. Recognize their schedules and commitments, and involve them in communication and training plans.&#13;
   &#13;
5. Create a Communication Plan: Develop a comprehensive plan covering what the initiative entails, its benefits, and expectations. Assign preferred senders for different messages to ensure clarity and awareness.&#13;
&#13;
In your digital transformation journey, speed is crucial. An enterprise-grade low-code platform can be a strategic asset. However, don't let this speed be hindered by poor stakeholder management. Effective management can make a significant difference, earning the gratitude of both your stakeholders and your business.&#13;

The pandemic dramatically accelerated these trends, and the need to address them has become more urgent. Traditional retailers now have no choice but to transform their operating models.&#13;
&#13;
For retailers to change the way they work, they must &#13;
1. think differently, &#13;
2. adopt a more agile and omnichannel operating model, and&#13;
3. embrace the power of automation. &#13;
&#13;
Making this shift will require investments in three pillars.&#13;
&#13;
McKinsey &amp; Company research found that 52 percent of retail activities could be automated, at least partially.&#13;

Many companies have invested heavily in digital transformation, but despite the projected $6.8 trillion spent by 2023, they often fail to see the expected return on investment. This is due to a lack of understanding of the steps required for a successful transformation.&#13;
&#13;
Buying technology and investing in the latest tech tools is not enough to drive change. It's crucial to have the right processes, culture, and talent in place to fully utilize these tools. The failure to invest in skills development is a significant contributor to the lack of productivity gains from new technologies like AI. Convincing experienced employees and senior managers to embrace new tech tools can also be a challenge for many organizations.&#13;
&#13;
Many companies have fallen into the trap of thinking that technology alone will drive change. But the reality is, without the right processes, culture, and talent in place, even the best technology will fail to deliver results.&#13;

A basis on which all new technologies depend. Around 2.5 Quintillion bytes of data are created every day, most of which are created by consumers (online research, past purchases, mobile payments), whom all contribute to the development of consumer-centric strategies.&#13;
&#13;
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the ever-expanding network of interconnected internet-enabled devices that use data (stored in a large cloud) as their main currency. 50Bn devices connected by 2020 entail new business models for companies, new ways of processing and manufacturing and new ways of marketing and buying. Smart factories will be able to predict demand and prevent waste, produce more quickly and reduce bullwhip effects. From the demand side, consumers’ demands will be met in real-time, their needs sustained and their smart houses able to replenish food and detect security breaches.&#13;
&#13;
McKinsey estimates that the IoT has a total potential economic impact of $3.9 trillion to $11.1 trillion annually by 2025. Although still in its infancy, this technology is becoming a reality every day, with firms like Amazon and Google pioneering in the industry.]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Nov 2022 13:32:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Post 388</title><link>https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:share:7093989296520491008</link><description>&lt;![CDATA[Companies often assume that if they embrace digital technology in any way, they’re digitally transforming their business. As a result, they often make only ad hoc changes and investments in the digital arena, with ineffectual results. The challenge, to which most companies have yet to rise, is figuring out how to fully capture the different kinds of value that these technologies offer. &#13;
&#13;
Developing a strategy for digital transformation that fully leverages this value is also not easy. Without a comprehensive assessment of what digital technologies can offer, firms tend to assume that any application of modern digital technologies will lead to a digital transformation.&#13;
&#13;
Defined by Harvard Business Review there are four distinct tiers of digital transformation, each of which meets different strategic objectives and allows companies to maximize the value they capture from digital technologies:&#13;
&#13;
1. Tier One: Operational efficiencies&#13;
2. Tier Two: Advanced operational efficiencies&#13;
3. Tier Three: Data-driven services from value chains&#13;
4. Tier Four: Data-driven services from digital platforms&#13;
&#13;
To think properly about these four tiers of transformation, the first step is to recognize that modern digital technologies have two notable value drivers: data in its new expansive role, and emergent digital ecosystems.&#13;

• 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝗮 𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗽𝗶𝗽𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘁𝗶𝗰𝘀 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺. You need to collect, store, process, and analyze the data from your sensors in real-time or near real-time. You also need to apply advanced analytics techniques, such as machine learning, to build predictive models and generate insights.&#13;
• 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗳𝗹𝗼𝘄𝘀. You need to ensure that your IoT solution can communicate with your enterprise systems, such as ERP, CRM, or MES. You also need to design and automate the workflows for preventive actions, such as scheduling maintenance, ordering spare parts, or notifying technicians.&#13;
• 𝗘𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘂𝗹𝘁𝘀. You need to track and report the outcomes of your predictive maintenance solution, such as reduced downtime, improved efficiency, or increased customer satisfaction. You also need to continuously monitor and refine your models and processes to ensure optimal performance.&#13;
&#13;
Predictive maintenance can bring significant value to your business if C-level executives take concrete steps to implement this strategy. According to a report by McKinsey, predictive maintenance can reduce downtime by 50 percent, extend machine life by 20 to 40 percent, and lower equipment and capital investment by 3 to 5 percent. By using IoT devices to collect data from equipment sensors, businesses can monitor performance and identify potential issues before they lead to downtime. &#13;

It connects people and places, enables trade and commerce, and provides vital services and utilities. But the current state of infrastructure is facing enormous challenges. &#13;
&#13;
The entire process – from planning and design, to construction, management and maintenance – can involve hundreds of vendors and other stakeholders, and span decades. Moreover, the demands of urbanization, digitalization, social expectations, and green growth require infrastructure to be more efficient, resilient, and sustainable. We need to transform both the existing infrastructure and the way new infrastructure is planned, delivered and managed. It's is important to embrace the opportunities of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Just as manufacturing has evolved to industry 4.0 and energy has advanced to electricity 4.0, infrastructure also needs to enter a 4.0 phase in which modern technologies and management approaches are leveraged to the fullest.&#13;
&#13;
Infrastructure 4.0 is about integrating digital technologies with physical assets. It’s about generating, harvesting, integrating, and analyzing data. It allows us to see and understand things that were previously too complex or interconnected to make sense of. It enables information to be shared more easily and to be made more meaningful to a wider range of people – from infrastructure professionals, to citizens, government, and investors. And it’s about enabling more collaborative ways of working.&#13;
&#13;
We can see the great benefits of implementing Infrastructure 4.0 and according to a survey by Accenture, digital technologies could unlock $1.6 trillion of value for the global infrastructure sector by 2025. Also, according to a study by BCG, digital solutions could reduce infrastructure costs by up to 20 percent and increase revenues by up to 30 percent. &#13;
&#13;
And what is also important to mention is that according to McKinsey, digital transformation could create up to 15 million new jobs in the infrastructure sector by 2030!&#13;

&#13;
We're at a phase in the adoption cycle when most organizations are starting to experiment by consuming foundation models "off the shelf." However, the biggest value for many will come when they customize or fine-tune models using their own data to address their unique needs.&#13;
&#13;
This is the potential that generative AI and foundation models offer. They will massively increase a company’s intelligence index and create new opportunities for every person in an organization to drive next-level innovation, optimization and reinvention. This will create new ways to elevate employee capabilities, delight customers, introduce new business models, and respond to signals of change.&#13;
&#13;
Companies will have thousands of ways to apply generative AI and foundation models to maximize efficiency and drive competitive advantage. But they’ll need to reinvent work to find a path to business value from this technology. Business leaders must lead the change, starting now, in 𝗷𝗼𝗯 𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻, 𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗸 𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗽𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲.&#13;
&#13;
To get started, consider the following adoption essentials:&#13;
&#13;
• Dive in, with a business-driven mindset.&#13;
• Take a people-first approach. &#13;
• Get your proprietary data ready.&#13;
• Invest in a sustainable tech foundation. &#13;
• Accelerate ecosystem innovation. &#13;
• Level up responsible AI. &#13;

CFOs who are implementing RPA consider investing in process mining as a vital factor in unlocking returns from the technology.&#13;
&#13;
In the survey, CFOs were asked about 16 different technologies under process automation and optimization. Only three technologies within this category are expected to see an increase in investments in the next two years: reporting automation, RPA, and process mining. Of these three technologies, only reporting automation was rated as delivering "high value" to finance departments at present.&#13;
&#13;
Finance processes are complex, exception-heavy, and rely on judgment and subject matter expertise. This currently limits the value creation of RPA, and CFOs need to explore additional options to enhance RPA's usefulness and, in some cases, choose better-fit technologies for their automation goals.&#13;
&#13;
📌 It's imperative for businesses to analyze: is your finance function on track with the digital curve? Ensure your organization stays ahead in this technological renaissance. Stay informed, stay ahead.&#13;

&#13;
Value innovation, not #technology innovation, is what launches commercially compelling new #markets!&#13;
&#13;
With limited resources at hand, companies need to stay smart and efficient when it comes to investing in innovation.&#13;
&#13;
This is a challenging time for many companies. On the one hand, supply chain disruption, labour shortage, raw material and energy price hikes are driving up business costs. On the other, demand is slack due to consumers’ reduced purchasing power and an uncertain global economic outlook. Together these conditions squeeze companies’ profits and cast a shadow on their #growth prospects. In this time of difficulty, executives around the world find it more urgent than ever to sharpen their organisations’ innovation #strategy to create new markets for growth.&#13;
&#13;
Economics has long taught us that R&amp;D and technology advances, as measured by R&amp;D spending and numbers of patents, are the central drivers of innovation and growth. But market creation for growth is not inevitably about technological innovation.&#13;
&#13;
With limited resources at hand, companies need to stay smart and efficient when it comes to investing in innovation. If technologies are involved, they should enable and facilitate the delivery of key buyer value elements, instead of making products or services too futuristic, esoteric or complicated for customers to adopt.&#13;

As per the report by Altimeter, a Prophet company, innovation dropped down to second place as increasing core business growth jumped to the top of the list of digital transformation goals (46%). &#13;
&#13;
Mature companies were far more likely to cite growth as their top goal (60%) than average companies, who were more likely to focus on replacing outdated technology and modernizing the workforce (49%). &#13;
&#13;
This highlights the gap between digitally mature companies, who have moved past the efforts to modernize and update technology and are now focusing on getting the best performance out of their existing systems. As the looming recession presents business challenges, we’ll see even more pressure for transformation efforts to show immediate, quantifiable business results rather than simply catching up with the times.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
📈Gartner expects that by 2026, 25% of people will spend at least one hour a day in the Metaverse for work, shopping, education, social media and/or entertainment.&#13;
&#13;
🎯It is a collective virtual space, created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical and digital reality. In other words, it is device-independent and is not owned by a single vendor. It is an independent virtual economy, enabled by digital currencies and nonfungible tokens (NFTs).&#13;
&#13;
A Metaverse represents a combinatorial innovation, as it requires multiple technologies and trends to function. Contributing tech capabilities include augmented reality (AR), flexible work styles, head-mounted displays (HMDs), an AR cloud, the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G, artificial intelligence (AI) and spatial technologies.&#13;
&#13;
💡To understand the concepts of a Metaverse, think of it as the next version of the Internet, which started as individual bulletin boards and independent online destinations. Eventually these destinations became sites on a virtual shared space — similar to how a Metaverse will develop.&#13;
&#13;
Are you ready for Metaverse?&#13;

At the heart of it, all are four key principles that can help unlock the potential for success. &#13;
&#13;
1. 𝗠𝗲𝗮𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗦𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺𝘀: Companies need to review and update their measurement systems to ensure that operational excellence, cost of goods (R&amp;D) optimization, customer acquisition (marketing and sales) and process digitization are all in sync.&#13;
&#13;
2. 𝗣𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝗦𝘂𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝗻: B2B software companies should design their employee experience and outcomes in a similar way to SaaS customer success. This means taking the time to understand how to get the best outcomes for employees and the company, and creating a strategy that looks at culture, compensation and rewards programs and cost efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
3. 𝗚𝗿𝗼𝘄𝘁𝗵 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝗵𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀: Strategies for profitable growth must include product-led and ecosystem-led expansion, exploring new channels and markets, improving customer net retention and expansion and end-to-end digitization of the customer journey.&#13;
&#13;
4. 𝗙𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗢𝗿𝗴𝗮𝗻𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Businesses should be prepared for an uncertain future, and replanning scenarios should include M&amp;A options, accelerating organizational and operational maturity and managing portfolios through the lens of profitable growth.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
This includes the extent to which an organization uses digital technologies, as well as the organization's overall readiness to face digital transformation. According to a study by McKinsey, the average company is only 20 per cent digitalized. This means that, on average, companies are only using digital technologies for 20 per cent of their operations. This low level of digital maturity is a major problem for businesses. In today's digital world, companies must be able to use digital technologies to remain competitive.&#13;
&#13;
There are a number of different ways to assess digital maturity and all include holistic assessments of the business. There are many benefits to assessing the digital maturity of enterprises. By doing so, companies can identify areas where they need to improve their digital capabilities. Additionally, digital maturity assessments can help organizations benchmark their progress and compare themselves to other companies. At the beginning of a digital transformation, companies use digital maturity assessments to holistically assess the businesses by covering many categories, such as customer journeys, digital supply chain, marketing personalization, governance, innovation, technology, customer, operations, and people. This early benchmarking becomes exponentially more valuable over the course of a digital transformation as companies track digital growth to identify where they’re gaining traction and where they’re falling behind. &#13;
Businesses with high levels of digital maturity have a competitive advantage along multiple performance indicators, including revenue growth, time to market, cost efficiency, product quality, and customer satisfaction. Businesses with low levels of digital maturity struggle to achieve these benefits. Digital maturity assessments can be beneficial for companies of all sizes. By assessing their digital maturity, companies can identify areas where they need to improve and make changes to become more digital. &#13;
&#13;
Given digital’s continued contribution to company performance, the gap between digital leaders and laggards will likely grow.&#13;

&#13;
Based on its experience with industrial clients, MIT Sloan School of Management has developed a strategy to avoid falling into the trap of purchasing technology that is underutilised or fails to deliver the desired business outcomes. It is recommended for a more gradual transition process that incorporates systems thinking and addresses cultural norms.&#13;
&#13;
This will translate lofty Industry 4.0 visions into actionable strategies and next steps to improve internal processes. The following are important steps:&#13;
&#13;
The initial stages of transformation will be driven by 𝗳𝗼𝗰𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝗻 𝗰𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺𝘀. Manufacturers frequently install networks of hundreds of sensors and then return to solve a specific problem. Problems are not solved by technology. In fact, technology has the potential to exacerbate problems by increasing data overload and eroding employees' trust in the new system.&#13;
&#13;
Instead of launching a full-scale network with hundreds of sensors, a more cautious approach that focuses on a specific problem and uses Industry 4.0 capabilities to solve it is recommended. Engaging employees to identify critical stress points in their jobs, as well as evaluating processes to identify opportunities for improvement and value creation, is critical for larger transformation.&#13;
&#13;
Begin by "𝘀𝗲𝗲𝗶𝗻𝗴" 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗳𝗲𝗲𝗱𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗹𝗼𝗼𝗽𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗺𝗶𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴. Knowing where to establish a feedback loop is critical to the business value of Industry 4.0, but the question is where to begin. The hunt for hidden factories can be fruitful because it allows you to listen to the system and identify the most significant gaps. It is also critical to implement processes that reduce the time between measurement and action. Data collected in a database or spreadsheet is insufficient to drive change.&#13;
&#13;
𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗱𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘄𝗵𝗶𝗹𝗲 𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝘂𝗻𝘀𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺𝘀. The implementation of new technologies such as sensors, cloud platforms, and advanced algorithms can provide workers with new insights. However, as soon as they encounter problems or complex and unwieldy systems, they will revert to old systems and traditional ways of working.&#13;
&#13;
Workers can more easily digest new systems and adjust to new work patterns if Industry 4.0 initiatives are tightly scoped and incremental. Simultaneously, old systems must be removed to eliminate fallback options.&#13;

The key to successful digital transformation is not just about investing in technology, but rather about cultivating a digital mindset throughout the organization, with its leaders leading by example. Research has shown that significant changes can only be achieved when technical and cultural transformations align with business strategy, which in turn can lead to substantial increases in business revenues.&#13;
&#13;
It is important for leaders to move away from the traditional command-and-control leadership style, which is not conducive to digital transformation efforts. Instead, leaders must remain open to new possibilities and embrace continuous change, while helping employees feel comfortable with the transition. By doing so, organizations can establish a culture of innovation and flexibility that is necessary for digital transformation success.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
It’s estimated that nearly every aspect of work will be optimized by data by 2025—and organizations able to make the most progress fastest stand to capture the highest value. Companies that embrace digital technologies and harness the power of data already have the upper hand when it comes to decision-making, problem-solving, employee satisfaction, and performance.&#13;
&#13;
📈Those able to make the most progress fastest stand to capture the highest value from data-supported capabilities. Companies already seeing 20 percent of their earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) contributed by artificial intelligence (AI), for example, are far more likely to engage in data practices.&#13;
&#13;
According to McKinsey &amp; Company, seven characteristics will define this new data-driven enterprise:&#13;
1. Data embedded in every decision, interaction, and process&#13;
2. Data is processed and delivered in real time&#13;
3. Flexible data stores enable integrated, ready-to-use data&#13;
4. Data operating model treats data like a product&#13;
5. The chief data officer’s role is expanded to generate value&#13;
6. Data-ecosystem memberships are the norm&#13;
7. Data management is prioritized and automated for privacy, security, and resiliency&#13;

Harvard Business Review found it can sometimes cause problems if it makes teams work poorly together.&#13;
&#13;
The real game-changers? How a company is built, managed, and organized. &#13;
&#13;
These factors decide if a company really stands out. There are five key stages in becoming a fully digital company:&#13;
&#13;
• Traditional Model - Starting point, with very little digital.&#13;
• Bridge Model - Teams start to work together, with some digital projects.&#13;
• Hubs Model - A special team leads digital work, but not everyone is involved yet.&#13;
• Platform Model - Digital is a big part of how the company works, used by everyone.&#13;
• Native Model - Digital is at the heart of everything the company does.&#13;

But when it comes to our time, we don’t pay much attention. The good news is that there are simple and effective time management ways to reclaim some of your time. &#13;
&#13;
Tasks that are based on processes and can’t be automated should at least be assigned or hired out. If it’s a low-risk, repetitive, simple task that someone else can do for you at a lower cost than your hourly rate, why are you still doing it? Nowadays you can consider AI tools as your personal assistants.&#13;
&#13;
Most decisions can be reversed and should be done quickly. If a meeting is not necessary, use tools that allow communication without synchrony; the truth is that most things don’t need an immediate answer. While you’ll have to invest some time to save time at first, like compound interest, over the long term, you will gain much more time than you spend.&#13;

Let's explore the three primary models that can guide your strategy.&#13;
&#13;
Developing an effective operating model that brings together business, technology, and operations is a challenging aspect of digital and AI transformations. This is because it involves the core of the organization and how its employees work.&#13;
&#13;
There are three primary models that have emerged: digital factory, product and platform, and enterprise-wide agile. These models are based on two key concepts. &#13;
&#13;
Firstly, small and diverse agile teams, or "pods," are the most efficient and effective way to develop a product or service. Secondly, these pods work best when some are solely focused on enhancing the customer or user experience (known as product pods, experience pods, or journey pods), while others concentrate on creating reusable services that can speed up the work of all pods (referred to as platform pods). Examples of such services could include a customer-360 data set or a simple way for teams to allocate computing and storage capacity.&#13;

&#13;
Such a culture is required for the successful implementation of a Big Data strategy. According to this roadmap, the best way to get started with Big Data is to first understand what it is and what it can do for your organisation, and then work with a multidisciplinary team to develop Proof of Concepts. These initial Proof of Concepts are critical for your company's data-driven transformation and should be shared with all employees.&#13;
&#13;
Knowledgent's infographic below depicts five levels of Big Data maturity within an organisation. The first level is referred to as the Infancy phase, and it is the stage at which one begins to understand Big Data and develop Proof of Concepts. &#13;
&#13;
The second level they identified is the technical adoption phase, in which the company prepares to implement various Big Data technologies. These technologies, whether on-premises or in the cloud, will allow a company to develop new Proof of Concepts / products or Big Data services more quickly and effectively.&#13;
&#13;
An organisation enters level 3 of the Big Data maturity index once the IT department is capable of working with Big Data technologies and the business understands what Big Data can do for them. More in-depth analysis of structured and unstructured data available within the company will result in more insights and better decision-making.&#13;
&#13;
Level 4 is where Big Data analytics has become an integral part of the company's culture and has resulted in integrated predictive insights into business operations. This is the final level before becoming a fully data-driven organisation that operates as a "data service provider." Companies that have achieved level 5 of the Big Data maturity index have integrated Big Data analytics at all levels of their organisation, are truly data-driven, and can be considered 'data companies' regardless of the product or service they provide. Based on their Big Data insights, they will significantly outperform their competitors.&#13;
&#13;
⚡All businesses should strive for Big Data maturity level 5 because it will lead to better decision-making, better products, and better service.&#13;

&#13;
With massive inflation raising their costs and recession fears dampening demand for their goods and services, businesses across the country are busy cutting wasteful spending and looking for new growth opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
Determining where, when, and how much to spend is always essential, but it's especially important during a downturn when such decisions can have a significant impact on a company's medium-term growth prospects once the economy recovers.

In a recent article by the World Economic Forum (WEF), three megatrends have been emphasized to be driving the factories of the future: &#13;
&#13;
1. 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗶𝘁𝘆: digital technologies such as cloud computing, the internet of things (IoT), 5G and blockchain are enabling unprecedented levels of data collection, sharing and analysis across the entire value chain. This allows manufacturers to optimize their operations, enhance their customer experience and create new business models. For example, one of the WEF's lighthouse factories in China uses IoT sensors to monitor its equipment performance and maintenance needs in real-time, 𝗿𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗱𝗼𝘄𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝗯𝘆 𝟱𝟬% 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗯𝘆 𝟮𝟱%.&#13;
   &#13;
2. 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲: artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), analytics and augmented reality (AR) are empowering manufacturers to leverage data for better decision-making, problem-solving and innovation. These technologies can help manufacturers improve their quality, efficiency, safety and sustainability. WEF's other lighthouse factory in Germany uses AI to analyze data from its production lines and identify defects before they become costly issues.&#13;
   &#13;
3. 𝗙𝗹𝗲𝘅𝗶𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: smart robotics, additive manufacturing (AM), cobots and digital twins are enabling manufacturers to automate their processes with more flexibility and agility. These technologies can help manufacturers adapt to changing customer demands, market conditions and environmental factors. A lighthouse factory in Sweden uses AM to produce customized parts on demand, 𝗿𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝗻𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆 𝗰𝗼𝘀𝘁𝘀 𝗯𝘆 𝟱𝟬% 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗱 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲𝘀 𝗯𝘆 𝟵𝟬%.&#13;
&#13;
These three megatrends are not only transforming individual factories but also creating a network of connected factories that can collaborate and learn from each other. This will require a new mindset and skillset for both managers and workers who need to embrace digital innovation as a strategic priority.&#13;

&#13;
In the digital era, transformation is not just about cloud migration or SaaS—it's a complete integration of technology into the core of the business, reshaping value delivery. Yet, many attempts to transform still fall short. Let's change that narrative. Here are six pivotal steps for a successful digital transformation:&#13;
&#13;
1. Outcome-Focused Strategy:&#13;
Start with a clear strategic plan centred on outcomes, considering both immediate and long-term goals. Link digital transformation to mission outcomes to enhance operations, employee experiences, and customer service. Prioritize security and compliance for scalability and resilience.&#13;
&#13;
2. Domain-Experienced Talent:&#13;
Select team members with industry, business, or specific domain knowledge. For example, military experience for defence systems, business acumen for revenue projects, or data science expertise for AI initiatives. Blend talent with domain experience to boost team cohesion, communication, and swift decision-making.&#13;
&#13;
3. User-Centric Adoption Plan:&#13;
Success is when users embrace and weave technology into their daily tasks. Foster user enthusiasm by involving them in the transformation process, ensuring a smoother transition at launch.&#13;
&#13;
4. Revise Outdated Processes:&#13;
Update or eliminate old processes and policies that don't align with the new digital workflows. Prepare policies and workflows in advance for seamless user adoption, executed in incremental phases.&#13;
&#13;
5. Organizational Alignment:&#13;
Secure enterprise-wide agreement from the top down. Understand that transformation is a phased journey requiring long-term dedication. This consensus will mitigate the impact of shifting priorities and emergencies.&#13;
&#13;
6. Agile and Resilient Approach:&#13;
Adopt agile methodologies for continuous, iterative releases, allowing for prompt feedback and adjustments. Embrace a "fail fast" mindset to stay aligned with market and technological advancements.&#13;

Often, those actions involve what’s commonly called “digital transformation”—implementing new tools, platforms, and business models to create competitive differentiation. &#13;
&#13;
But while CEOs constantly hear that they should lead any significant digital transformation, it’s not always easy to know exactly how to do that. As technology continues to grow in complexity, it is harder for CEOs to take a direct role in leading these transformations. At the same time, intensifying environmental disruption makes transformation an increasingly strategic lever that CEOs must lead. &#13;

Its abstract nature leaves many wondering if this emerging technology is the global game changer that evangelists claim it to be. But as a report from McKinsey &amp; Company suggests, blockchain is more of a tool than a catalyst, not a one-size-fits-all solution, but a new foundation that can underpin our everyday tasks and bring about a techno-driven facelift to various industries.&#13;
&#13;
According to the study, blockchain has the potential to increase productivity by up to 30%, ensure transparency and reduce wasted time and paperwork in various industries. Its core advantages revolve around its lack of a central hub, the transparency of a distributed ledger combined with the cryptographic security of an immutable data chain makes this technology the ideal vehicle for businesses to exchange and validate the information. It's not a single system, but a baseline technology that can be configured in different ways to suit different purposes and business models.&#13;
&#13;
Additionally, a study from Accenture also emphasizes the potential of blockchain in reducing costs and driving operational efficiencies. The study estimates that blockchain could save the banking industry up to $𝟴𝗯𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗻𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 and the global supply chain up to $𝟭.𝟭𝘁𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗻𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆.&#13;
&#13;
While it's true that blockchain is still an immature technology and there are kinks to be worked out before it can scale effectively, the potential benefits it brings in the short term are undeniable. It's time for businesses to start exploring the potential of blockchain and how it can bring value to their operations.&#13;

By reinventing the organization!&#13;
&#13;
The management concepts that the org chart visualizes—coordination, hierarchy, a matrixed organization—are the one's leaders grew up with and know best, as did generations before them. The original org chart hailed from 1854 and was introduced to help run the New York and Erie Railroad during the age of the steam locomotive.&#13;
&#13;
Therein lies the challenge. Today’s organizations are set up as traditional hierarchies or matrix organizations with roots stretching back to the industrial revolutions of the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. In theory, these structures provide clear lines of authority from frontline employees up through layers of management. In reality, matrix structures have only grown more complex as the business has—to the extent that in some companies they are so cumbersome they hardly function.&#13;

&#13;
Technologies that challenge the status quo are those that enable digital transformation. Digital transformation is a process of using technology to create new or improved business processes, products, or services. This can be done in order to reduce costs, improve efficiency, or create new revenue streams.&#13;
&#13;
Digital transformation can be enabled by a number of different technologies, including cloud computing, artificial intelligence, big data, and the Internet of Things. These technologies can challenge the status quo by making it possible to do things that were previously not possible, or by making existing processes more efficient.&#13;
&#13;
The benefits of digital transformation can be significant. For example, Accenture estimates that digital transformation can help companies achieve a 30 percent reduction in costs. McKinsey has found that companies that have embraced digital transformation are 26 percent more profitable than their peers.&#13;
&#13;
However, digital transformation can also be disruptive. It can challenge existing business models and lead to the need for new skills and processes. As such, it is important for companies to carefully consider how they can best take advantage of digital transformation while minimizing its risks.&#13;
&#13;
Innovation and constant breakthroughs in the worlds of business and IT mean that the status quo of running a business is constantly shifting. BPM (Business Process Management) itself has shifted from a one-time initiative to a constant process.&#13;

The World Economic Forum Future of Jobs Report 2023 says that AI and machine learning specialists, data analysts and scientists, and digital transformation specialists are among the fastest-growing roles.&#13;
&#13;
But artificial intelligence could also displace millions of people from their roles.&#13;
&#13;
It cannot replace all roles – AI is unlikely to be able to do jobs requiring human skills such as judgement, creativity, physical dexterity and emotional intelligence. &#13;
&#13;
So, what jobs can’t AI replace?&#13;

&#13;
The right applications of technology can lead to more empowered decision-making; new opportunities for upskilling, reskilling, and cross-functional collaboration; better talent attraction and retention; and improved workplace safety and employee satisfaction.&#13;
&#13;
Customers see the impacts through reduced manufacturing lead times, right-first-time launch management, and improved customer service and complexity management. And, of course, there are the win–win advantages associated with reduced environmental impact, made possible through lower emissions and reduced waste and more efficient energy, water, and raw-material consumption.&#13;
&#13;
These productivity, process, and people improvements are not easy to accomplish—especially across a network of individual manufacturing sites, each with its own site leadership, IT infrastructure, and workplace culture. It is not uncommon to hear of companies achieving impressive results through pilot programs at one factory site only to find themselves unable to replicate these local wins across their network.&#13;
&#13;
The digitally enabled factory of today looks very different from the leading factory of ten years ago. Advances in data and analytics, AI, and ML—and the array of technology vendors in the market—mean manufacturers can choose from hundreds of potential solutions and tech applications to improve their ways of working.&#13;
&#13;
Implemented successfully, these solutions deliver irresistible returns.

These technologies enable communication, analysis, and action based on information, allowing organizations, consumers, and society to be more agile and adaptive and make more informed, data-driven decisions.&#13;
&#13;
It is not a distant vision—it is a present reality and a priority for C-suite executives and government agencies who are responding to the rapid changes brought by advanced digital technologies. Deloitte's annual survey explored the intersection of readiness and responsibility to see how leaders are managing this transition to Industry 4.0. The survey results show that these technologies—especially IoT, AI, and cloud infrastructure—are expected to have a significant impact on how businesses operate and participate in global trade.&#13;

This problem is the lack of an effective “method” — a systematic or established procedure to undertake something, step by step. But methods can be learned. A 6-step method developed by Dr Graham Kenny include:&#13;
&#13;
1. Recognize your dependencies, i.e. your key stakeholders&#13;
2. Identify your “target customer” &#13;
3. Define what your organization wants from each key stakeholder group for your organization to prosper&#13;
4. Identify what these stakeholder groups want from you&#13;
5. Strategy design, involves deciding what your organization’s positions will be on the identified strategic factors for each key stakeholder group&#13;
6. Continuous improvement&#13;

Does it have a data strategy?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
With the global landscape changing at a frenetic pace, an organization’s ability to be agile and make productive use of data is now central to its long-term success.&#13;
&#13;
Companies able to harness data’s full value will likely leapfrog those struggling with technology and organizational change. Experts suggest up to 6% of global output is at risk over the next decade, a result of the digital divide between those able to capitalize on data and those still struggling to figure out its role and what’s at stake.&#13;
&#13;
There are four directives for improving companies’ ability to reap the rewards of data and a platform-based ecosystem:&#13;
&#13;
1. Understand the true power of data.&#13;
2. Scale up projects for impact.&#13;
3. Orient key stakeholders.&#13;
4. Formulate a platform vision.&#13;

1. An Integrated Strategy with Clear Transformation Goals. The strategy describes the why, the what, and the how of a transformation, each of which are tied to specific, quantified business outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
2. Leadership Commitment from CEO Through Middle Management. The company has high leadership engagement and alignment, including often-overlooked middle-management ownership and accountability.&#13;
&#13;
3. Deploying High-Caliber Talent. Management identifies and frees up the most capable resources to drive the transformation program.&#13;
&#13;
4. An Agile Governance Mindset That Drives Broader Adoption. Leaders address roadblocks quickly, adapt to changing contexts, and drive cross-functional, mission-oriented, “fail-fast-learn” behavioural change into the wider organization. They deal with individual challenges without losing sight of the broader goals.&#13;
&#13;
5.  Effective Monitoring of Progress Toward Defined Outcomes. The company establishes clear metrics and targets around processes and outcomes, with sufficient data availability and quality.&#13;
&#13;
6. Business-Led Modular Technology and Data Platform. The company puts in place a fit-for-purpose, modern technology architecture driven by business needs to enable secure, scalable performance, rapid change deployment, and seamless ecosystem integration.&#13;

&#13;
Legacy organizations face a major challenge - outdated systems and processes that resist seamless integration with cutting-edge technologies. As a result, their efforts to innovate services and experiences through API-driven digital technology integration often fail.&#13;
&#13;
🔄 The Solution? Fully automated migration. This approach leverages refactoring technology to transmute legacy code and data into modern, compatible formats.&#13;
&#13;
📊 According to a study by McKinsey &amp; Company, a mere 16% of companies report successful and sustainable performance improvements from their digital transformation initiatives. A further 7% achieved temporary improvements. Clearly, there's a gap between ambition and outcome.&#13;
&#13;
🌐 Why Digital Transformation Matters: Today, the business landscape has never been more competitive, failing to embrace digital innovation isn't just a missed opportunity—it's a direct path to obsolescence. &#13;
&#13;
⚡Digital transformation is key to enhancing operational efficiency, slashing costs, and elevating customer experiences.&#13;
&#13;
🎯 The key is to have a strategic approach. It's not just about adopting new technology—it's about a strategic overhaul. This includes:&#13;
&#13;
1. Pinpointing areas for maximal impact.&#13;
2. Crafting a detailed implementation roadmap.&#13;

Change is essential for any organization that wants to stay competitive and relevant in today's environment. However, many change efforts fail or fall short of their goals. One of the reasons is that leaders use the same traditional change management methods regardless of the context they face. These methods may not be suitable for contexts that are unpredictable, interdependent, or complicated.&#13;
&#13;
The BCG Henderson Institute, has developed a new framework called Strategies of Change which helps leaders choose the right change interventions based on the characteristics of their change context.&#13;
&#13;
The framework identifies four change context archetypes: simple, unpredictable, interdependent, and complicated. Each archetype requires a different change philosophy and a set of interventions to spread change effectively.&#13;
&#13;
• 𝗦𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲 contexts are those in which traditional change management works well and should be deployed.&#13;
• 𝗨𝗻𝗽𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗰𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 contexts are those in which systematizing learning works well. Leaders can create statistical learning systems that encourage experimentation, aggregate learnings, and iteratively adapt approaches.&#13;
• 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗱𝗲𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗻𝘁 contexts are those in which engineering contagion works well. Leaders can leverage the organization's own networks of reciprocal influence by amplifying beneficial behaviors, restructuring connections, and engineering interactions.&#13;
• 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱 contexts are those in which transforming for simplicity works well. Leaders can simplify the change context by standardizing behaviors, segmenting the organization, or probing the system.&#13;

According to a recent report by McKinsey, 70% of change management initiatives fail due to a lack of employee engagement and support. Therefore, prioritizing people is crucial for successful change management.&#13;
&#13;
McKinsey provided a holistic perspective which suggests that four basic conditions are necessary before employees will change their behaviour: &#13;
&#13;
1️⃣𝗮 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆, because employees must see the point of the change and agree with it. &#13;
&#13;
2️⃣𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴, because they must also see the CEO and colleagues, they admire behaving in a new way. &#13;
&#13;
3️⃣𝗿𝗲𝗶𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗺𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗶𝘀𝗺𝘀, because systems, processes, and incentives must be in line with the new behaviour and&#13;
&#13;
4️⃣𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴, because employees must have the skills required to make the desired changes.&#13;
&#13;
📌 By embracing change with a people-focused approach, effective change management empowers employees to navigate transitions and achieve their desired outcomes. This approach can lead to increased productivity, improved morale, and overall success, inspiring individuals and organizations alike to reach their full potential.&#13;

&#13;
As mentioned by Peter Sondergaard in a keynote speech, every company becomes a software company. &#13;
&#13;
Per McKinsey research from June 2022, 𝗻𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗹𝘆 𝟳𝟬 𝗽𝗲𝗿 𝗰𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝗽 𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗼𝗺𝗶𝗰 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗲𝗿𝘀, compared with just half of their peers, are using their own software to differentiate themselves from their competitors. Fully one-third of those top performers monetize software directly.&#13;
&#13;
Three shifts are driving the need to evolve: accelerated adoption of digital products, increased value from the software, and cloud, platform and AI tools giving more power to billions of workers. Companies recognize the importance of software, yet struggle to make the foundational changes needed to become software businesses. Transformation models exist, though non-tech companies capture less than 7% of software revenue.&#13;
&#13;
Also, many companies nowadays rely on software and its capabilities to perform their day-to-day businesses. This trend is growing and every company is undoubtedly becoming a software company. Consider low-code or no-code platforms, for example, where employees can create specific apps to do very specific and company-related tasks.&#13;

&#13;
Successfully implementing large-scale change demands focus on five key areas.&#13;
&#13;
𝗗𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹-𝗙𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁 𝗕𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝘆&#13;
Today, every company is a tech company. By integrating tech into your business strategy, you not only cut costs but also set a clear path for growth. Your tech choices today are crucial for future success.&#13;
&#13;
𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗺𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀&#13;
Adapting new digital methods is essential for business agility and success. Start by asking what your customers and employees need. This can lead to better customer service, cloud adoption, and sustainable practices across your business.&#13;
&#13;
𝗔𝗴𝗶𝗹𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗖𝘂𝗹𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲&#13;
Rapid change and rising customer expectations make agility a must. Many companies misdirect their tech investments due to a lack of focus on innovation. Effective digital transformation shifts this perspective, viewing tech as an enabler and people as adaptable.&#13;
&#13;
𝗙𝗹𝗲𝘅𝗶𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝗖𝗼𝗿𝗲&#13;
Don't get stuck with one technology. Being agile lets you innovate and form partnerships that scale your business quickly. A modular tech approach keeps you adaptable and customer-centric.&#13;
&#13;
𝗣𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲-𝗖𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁&#13;
Digital transformation touches every part of a business. Success needs a strong digital foundation, backed by leadership and a culture open to tech adoption. Key issues like the future of work and role evolution need addressing. Skilled leadership and an upskilled workforce are essential, especially in a remote environment.&#13;
&#13;
Digital transformation is as much about people as it is about technology. Align your culture and skills to make the most of your digital plans.&#13;

&#13;
According to PwC, 𝟮𝟰 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝗶𝗻𝗱𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝘂𝗳𝗮𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗖𝗘𝗢𝘀 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝗿 𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗯𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝘆, which allows them to optimise operations, gain greater visibility into supply networks, and manage assets with unparalleled precision.&#13;
&#13;
Many manufacturers make products by assembling hundreds or thousands of parts from various suppliers. Blockchain can assist manufacturers in tracking each of those parts before, during, and after production. Automobile manufacturers, for example, assemble vehicles using thousands of components sourced from hundreds of vendors. They are ultimately accountable for the car's reliability and safety, but if there is an issue that necessitates a product recall, they must locate and replace the defective parts. This allows the manufacturer to identify and resolve issues considerably more quickly and efficiently.&#13;
&#13;
Blockchain has various applications, but in manufacturing it offers operational transparency, speed, efficiency, and confidence among business partners.&#13;
Consider a blockchain network that tracks interactions between manufacturers, suppliers, and business partners. Manufacturers obtain real-time insight into all transactions with their suppliers, as well as a complete history of their working relationship with each business partner, with necessary authorization. &#13;
&#13;
Some other benefits are:&#13;
1.	Improved traceability&#13;
2.	Enhanced inventory management&#13;
3.	Optimized data security&#13;
4.	Automated payments&#13;
5.	Improved human resources management&#13;

Yet failure rarely offers valuable business lessons, according to the MIT Sloan Center for Information Systems Research.&#13;
&#13;
Instead of failing fast, companies should “learn fast” by designing initiatives to ensure learning, instead of hoping that failure leads to insight. This type of thinking requires a cultural shift from organizational hierarchy to small, cross-functioning teams, and employees should be encouraged to test hypotheses by asking probing questions and admitting what they don’t know. The challenge is to be much more purposeful about what you’re doing.&#13;

This popularity might be due to the growing 𝗱𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 of enterprises, which has led them to embrace cloud-based platforms and services. Low-code/no-code platforms make it possible for enterprises to design and integrate custom apps without hiring extra developers.&#13;
&#13;
Because of the capacity to interface with new tools and technologies, the low-code market has evolved. The standard capabilities have not altered, but they have expanded into areas like user experiences, data management, and process automation.&#13;
&#13;
Low code is beneficial for businesses of all sizes. However, businesses must embrace digital transformation and be willing to adapt their operations to implement low-code approaches.&#13;
&#13;
The needs of businesses and developers are comparable in the market's enterprise and startup/small business segments. In fact, developer tools are evolving in the same way that business users' tools are. Low-code/no-code platforms are rapidly maturing and expanding to integrate with other artificial intelligence technologies.&#13;

&#13;
It’s estimated that nearly every aspect of work will be optimized by data by 2025—and organizations able to make the most progress fastest stand to capture the highest value. Companies that embrace digital technologies and harness the power of data already have the upper hand when it comes to decision-making, problem-solving, employee satisfaction, and performance.&#13;
&#13;
Those able to make the most progress fastest stand to capture the highest value from data-supported capabilities. Companies already seeing 20 per cent of their earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) contributed by artificial intelligence (AI), for example, are far more likely to engage in data practices.&#13;
&#13;
According to McKinsey &amp; Company, seven characteristics will define this new data-driven enterprise:&#13;
1. Data embedded in every decision, interaction, and process&#13;
2. Data is processed and delivered in real-time&#13;
3. Flexible data stores enable integrated, ready-to-use data&#13;
4. The data operating model treats data like a product&#13;
5. The chief data officer’s role is expanded to generate value&#13;
6. Data-ecosystem memberships are the norm&#13;
7. Data management is prioritized and automated for privacy, security, and resiliency&#13;

&#13;
The result doesn't surprise me. The resistance to change has always been one of the biggest challenges in every organization. And is strictly related to the people (employees) - the culture of the company, the way employees perceive their managers/leaders, and the company itself. &#13;
&#13;
The moral: for any change you need to have employees' buy-in. Their approval and clear understanding of "what's in it for them". Otherwise, it's a waste of money and time. Focus on stakeholder and change management, leaving the technology for the end.&#13;

&#13;
In addition to external trading partners, suppliers, customers, third-party data service providers, and all of their various technologies, a digital ecosystem also includes internal solutions, apps, and systems.&#13;
&#13;
As a dynamic, interconnected network, the digital ecosystem requires dependable communication between customers and business partners. When a digital ecosystem is connected, businesses can use both new and old technology to flourish continuously. These technologies can be surrounded by automated procedures.&#13;
&#13;
By merging B2B, application, and data linkages to the whole business network, an integrated digital ecosystem enables enterprises to construct end-to-end business flows from the "outside-in."&#13;
&#13;
⚡Enterprises may run business activities more effectively and in a fully manageable way thanks to digital ecosystems. Here are the top three ways that ecosystems with digital integration create value.&#13;
&#13;
1. 𝗖𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗦𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗥𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘂𝗲&#13;
Through consolidated ecosystem integration, which enables businesses to collect and analyse the vast amounts of data moving through their company and use it to develop new products and services, digital ecosystems help businesses generate new revenue streams. Such integration improves existing income-generating procedures while also developing value-added services for emerging revenue streams.&#13;
&#13;
2. 𝗟𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿 𝗖𝗼𝘀𝘁𝘀 𝗧𝗵𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝗕𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀&#13;
Companies that have embraced ecosystem integration platforms and digital transformation are also realising quantifiable cost benefits. End-to-end integration not only increases workflow effectiveness but also enhances working relationships with clients and partners and lowers operational expenses due to business-wide efficiency and automated data processing.&#13;
&#13;
3. 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝗼𝗳 𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝘆 𝗔𝗱𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻&#13;
A plan for ecosystem integration helps businesses to completely use new technologies in previously challenging ways. Instead of relying on antiquated legacy software that cannot keep up with the pace of the enterprise today, businesses may now take use of contemporary cloud services and SaaS solutions.&#13;

And they are correct: AI will automate many of these tasks. Actually, 86% said they would like AI support with monitoring and reporting.&#13;
&#13;
The limitations of AI in making decisions are clear, as it can only extract so much information from data. This is where human judgment comes in, as managers utilize their understanding of organizational history and culture, as well as empathy and ethical considerations, to make crucial business decisions. This combination of experience and expertise is known as human judgment. The same survey indicates that managers recognize the need for this skill, and see 𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴, 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻, 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝘆 𝗱𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗺𝗲𝗻t as the top four essential skills for future success.&#13;

&#13;
Based on its experience with industrial clients, MIT Sloan School of Management has developed a strategy to avoid falling into the trap of purchasing technology that is underutilised or fails to deliver the desired business outcomes. It is recommended for a more gradual transition process that incorporates systems thinking and addresses cultural norms.&#13;
&#13;
This will translate lofty Industry 4.0 visions into actionable strategies and next steps to improve internal processes. The following are important steps:&#13;
&#13;
The initial stages of transformation will be driven by 𝗳𝗼𝗰𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝗻 𝗰𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺𝘀. Manufacturers frequently install networks of hundreds of sensors and then return to solve a specific problem. Problems are not solved by technology. In fact, technology has the potential to exacerbate problems by increasing data overload and eroding employees' trust in the new system.&#13;
&#13;
Instead of launching a full-scale network with hundreds of sensors, a more cautious approach that focuses on a specific problem and uses Industry 4.0 capabilities to solve it is recommended. Engaging employees to identify critical stress points in their jobs, as well as evaluating processes to identify opportunities for improvement and value creation, is critical for larger transformation.&#13;
&#13;
Begin by "𝘀𝗲𝗲𝗶𝗻𝗴" 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗳𝗲𝗲𝗱𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗹𝗼𝗼𝗽𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗺𝗶𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴. Knowing where to establish a feedback loop is critical to the business value of Industry 4.0, but the question is where to begin. The hunt for hidden factories can be fruitful because it allows you to listen to the system and identify the most significant gaps. It is also critical to implement processes that reduce the time between measurement and action. Data collected in a database or spreadsheet is insufficient to drive change.&#13;
&#13;
𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗱𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘄𝗵𝗶𝗹𝗲 𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝘂𝗻𝘀𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺𝘀. The implementation of new technologies such as sensors, cloud platforms, and advanced algorithms can provide workers with new insights. However, as soon as they encounter problems or complex and unwieldy systems, they will revert to old systems and traditional ways of working.&#13;
&#13;
Workers can more easily digest new systems and adjust to new work patterns if Industry 4.0 initiatives are tightly scoped and incremental. Simultaneously, old systems must be removed to eliminate fallback options.&#13;

Previously, we celebrated individual achievements, but now, we prioritize team collaboration. &#13;
&#13;
❓Why? &#13;
&#13;
Because the perfect blend of technology and teamwork is essential for creating the businesses of tomorrow.&#13;
&#13;
The focus has shifted from personal interactions to digital ones. &#13;
&#13;
The office environment has transformed, and remote working is now the norm. However, team spirit has remained a crucial factor in keeping us motivated. The effectiveness of the technology we use depends on how well we can collaborate with it.&#13;
&#13;
It's important to understand that communication is not the same as collaboration. While you may be communicating regularly with your team through chat apps, video platforms, and task trackers, it's the depth of your collaborative ties that determines how effectively you can use these tools. &#13;
&#13;
⚡To cultivate true teamwork, you need unified platforms, clear objectives, and a shared mission.&#13;
&#13;
Teamwork is not just about playing basketball or any sport. It's about understanding each other, growing together, and pushing boundaries. &#13;
&#13;
The same rule applies to the workplace. The best projects result when team members learn from each other, support each other, and work towards a shared vision.&#13;
&#13;
📌 Success is a result of true collaboration. It's not just about adopting digital tools; it's about using them effectively. &#13;
&#13;
Take a step back and evaluate your digital tools and strategies. Are they promoting true collaboration, or are they just facilitating communication? &#13;
&#13;
If it's the latter, it's time to make a shift. Remember, teamwork makes the dream work. &#13;

It would be comforting to think that we will all have sufficient time to adjust to the changes coming with generative AI. However, much like a foreshock can presage a large earthquake, this new epoch could be a precursor to one even more significant event, the coming 𝗔𝗜 𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘂𝗹𝗮𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆. &#13;
&#13;
AI singularity refers to two concepts: &#13;
1. The first defines “singularity” as a point when AI surpasses human intelligence, leading to rapid and exponential technological advancements. &#13;
2. The second refers to a belief that the technology will be able to improve itself at an accelerating rate, leading to a point where technological progress becomes so fast that it exceeds the human ability to understand or predict it. &#13;

One critical technology that has played a significant role in this transformative process is the Application Programming Interface (API). In today's complex, interconnected business landscape, integration is undeniably a key determinant of success.&#13;
&#13;
APIs are the building blocks of modern software, allowing applications and services to interact and share data seamlessly. By leveraging APIs, organizations can streamline processes, promote collaboration, and enable faster more efficient decision-making. In the context of Industry 4.0, API integration can be the cornerstone of digital transformation, driving broad-ranging benefits such as improved customer experience, increased operational efficiency, and enhanced revenue generation.&#13;
&#13;
To fully capitalize on the potential of APIs, organizations should invest in API management, adopting a structured approach to design, develop, and implement APIs securely and efficiently. Establishing API governance and cultivating an API-first culture is essential to harness the transformational power of APIs in a sustainable manner. API integration is undeniably vital in driving digital transformation and staying ahead of the competition in today's rapidly evolving business environment, augmenting operational efficiency and unlocking new revenue opportunities.&#13;

Your environment dictates your approach to strategy. You need to assess the environment and then match and apply the appropriate approach. But how do you characterize the business environment, and how do you choose which approach to strategy is best suited to the job of defining a winning course of action?&#13;
&#13;
Business environments differ along three easily discernible dimensions: &#13;
1. Predictability (can you forecast it?), &#13;
2. Malleability (can you, either alone or in collaboration with others, shape it?), and &#13;
3. Harshness (can you survive it?). &#13;
&#13;
Combining these dimensions into a matrix reveals five distinct environments, each of which requires a distinct approach to strategy and execution.&#13;
&#13;
Each environment corresponds to a distinct archetypal approach to strategy, or colour in the strategy palette, as follows: predictable classical environments lend themselves to strategies of position, which are based on advantage achieved through scale or differentiation or capabilities and are achieved through comprehensive analysis and planning. &#13;
&#13;
Adaptive environments require continuous experimentation because planning does not work under conditions of rapid change and unpredictability. In a visionary setting, firms win by being the first to create a new market or to disrupt an existing one. In a shaping environment, firms can collaboratively shape an industry to their advantage by orchestrating the activities of other stakeholders. &#13;
&#13;
Finally, under the harsh conditions of a renewal environment, a firm needs to first conserve and free up resources to ensure its viability and then go on to choose one of the other four approaches to rejuvenate growth and ensure long-term prosperity (remember COVID19?)&#13;

&#13;
We're at a phase in the adoption cycle when most organizations are starting to experiment by consuming foundation models "off the shelf." However, the biggest value for many will come when they customize or fine-tune models using their own data to address their unique needs.&#13;
&#13;
This is the potential that generative AI and foundation models offer. They will massively increase a company’s intelligence index and create new opportunities for every person in an organization to drive next-level innovation, optimization and reinvention. This will create new ways to elevate employee capabilities, delight customers, introduce new business models, and respond to signals of change.&#13;
&#13;
Companies will have thousands of ways to apply generative AI and foundation models to maximize efficiency and drive competitive advantage. But they’ll need to reinvent work to find a path to business value from this technology. Business leaders must lead the change, starting now, in 𝗷𝗼𝗯 𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻, 𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗸 𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗽𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲.&#13;
&#13;
To get started, consider the following adoption essentials:&#13;
&#13;
• Dive in, with a business-driven mindset.&#13;
• Take a people-first approach. &#13;
• Get your proprietary data ready.&#13;
• Invest in a sustainable tech foundation. &#13;
• Accelerate ecosystem innovation. &#13;
• Level up responsible AI. &#13;

We envision a world in which the distinction between physical and digital environments is blurred. Every asset, process, or person within and related to an enterprise will be virtualized—and linked. As a result, nearly every aspect of work can now take place entirely digitally or, at the very least, before it takes place physically. &#13;
&#13;
Immersive experiences enabled by augmented (AR) and virtual reality (VR) will allow employees to gain real-world product design experience and training from their desks as they manipulate 3-D digital replicas of equipment. &#13;
&#13;
Mass simulations and AI technologies will use data streams from within and outside the enterprise to help senior executives predict what will happen next with incredible accuracy and prescribe the best course of action in even the most turbulent of times.&#13;
&#13;
This is the enterprise metaverse—a digital, often immersive environment that replicates and connects every aspect of a company in order to optimise experiences and decision making. While the enterprise metaverse is still a dream, it has already begun with the development of the engines that will power it: digital twins.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Where traditional factories and even smart factories require some direct human interaction, true lights-out factories operate completely autonomously.&#13;
&#13;
Though it might sound like a dream, lights-out factories are fully automated, 24/7 factories with no on-floor human presence. And they already exist in the modern world.&#13;
&#13;
Japanese robotics designer FANUC has been using robots to build themselves in a lights-out factory for 20 years, and even electronics company Philips uses 128 robots in a lights-out manufacturing line to produce electric razors.&#13;
&#13;
One industry that uses lights-out manufacturing extensively in semiconductor manufacturing. ASE Global, the world’s leading provider of semiconductor manufacturing services in assembly and testing, used 18 completely automated factories in 2020 alone.&#13;
&#13;
Which industries will implement lights-out manufacturing? Robot installations since 2019 show that the automotive, electronics, and metal and machinery sectors are unsurprisingly leading the way in Industry 4.0 implementation.&#13;

Or is it just a list of activities and wishful thinking?&#13;
&#13;
One problem that often arises is the lack of a clear and effective method for undertaking a task systematically and step-by-step. &#13;
&#13;
However, methods can be learned and applied to improve the process. One such method is the 6-step approach developed by Dr Graham Kenny. It includes the following steps:&#13;
&#13;
1. Recognize your dependencies, i.e. your key stakeholders&#13;
2. Identify your “target customer” &#13;
3. Define what your organization wants from each key stakeholder group for your organization to prosper&#13;
4. Identify what these stakeholder groups want from you&#13;
5. Strategy design involves deciding what your organization’s positions will be on the identified strategic factors for each key stakeholder group&#13;
6. Continuous improvement&#13;

&#13;
Such a culture is required for the successful implementation of a Big Data strategy. According to this roadmap, the best way to get started with Big Data is to first understand what it is and what it can do for your organisation, and then work with a multidisciplinary team to develop Proof of Concepts. These initial Proof of Concepts are critical for your company's data-driven transformation and should be shared with all employees.&#13;
&#13;
Knowledgent's infographic below depicts five levels of Big Data maturity within an organisation. The first level is referred to as the Infancy phase, and it is the stage at which one begins to understand Big Data and develop Proof of Concepts. &#13;
&#13;
The second level they identified is the technical adoption phase, in which the company prepares to implement various Big Data technologies. These technologies, whether on-premises or in the cloud, will allow a company to develop new Proof of Concepts / products or Big Data services more quickly and effectively.&#13;
&#13;
An organisation enters level 3 of the Big Data maturity index once the IT department is capable of working with Big Data technologies and the business understands what Big Data can do for them. More in-depth analysis of structured and unstructured data available within the company will result in more insights and better decision-making.&#13;
&#13;
Level 4 is where Big Data analytics has become an integral part of the company's culture and has resulted in integrated predictive insights into business operations. This is the final level before becoming a fully data-driven organisation that operates as a "data service provider." Companies that have achieved level 5 of the Big Data maturity index have integrated Big Data analytics at all levels of their organisation, are truly data-driven, and can be considered 'data companies' regardless of the product or service they provide. Based on their Big Data insights, they will significantly outperform their competitors.&#13;
&#13;
⚡All businesses should strive for Big Data maturity level 5 because it will lead to better decision-making, better products, and better service.&#13;

To drive business resilience, growth, and profits, organizations need to couple radical efficiency with innovation and invest shrewdly in digital.&#13;
&#13;
Smart budget trade-offs, savvy talent strategies, and optimal digital investments will be key to success this year, with organizations focusing on driving margin improvement, generating cash, increasing the productivity of people and assets, and capitalizing on new growth opportunities with fewer resources.&#13;
&#13;
But to succeed, executives must tackle three variables that threaten to weigh down growth and profits in 2023: higher interest rates, lack of available talent, and lagging digital transformation. Higher funding costs reduce ROI and funding is harder to get and justify as investors prioritize investments that generate short-term profitability and cash flow over those that drive future growth. Critical talent, especially those with digital skills, remains expensive and in short supply, despite the slew of layoffs in the tech sector. Boards and CEOs now expect to see top or bottom-line benefits from digital investments, but many CIOs still struggle to demonstrate the business value of IT.&#13;
&#13;
To differentiate performance in 2023, executives need to manage resources and spend strategically, be agile in securing digital talent, and accelerate key digital and technology initiatives.

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
If the pace of the pre-coronavirus world was already fast, the luxury of time now seems to have disappeared completely. Businesses that once mapped digital strategy in one- to three-year phases must now scale their initiatives in a matter of days or weeks.&#13;
&#13;
In one European survey, about 70 percent of executives from Austria, Germany, and Switzerland said the pandemic is likely to accelerate the pace of their digital transformation. The quickening is evident already across sectors and geographies. Consider how Asian banks have swiftly migrated physical channels online. How healthcare providers have moved rapidly into telehealth, insurers into self-service claims assessment, and retailers into contactless shopping and delivery.&#13;
&#13;
The COVID-19 crisis seemingly provides a sudden glimpse into a future world, one in which digital has become central to every interaction, forcing both organizations and individuals further up the adoption curve almost overnight. A world in which digital channels become the primary (and, in some cases, sole) customer-engagement model, and automated processes become a primary driver of productivity—and the basis of flexible, transparent, and stable supply chains. A world in which agile ways of working are a prerequisite to meeting seemingly daily changes to customer behaviour.&#13;

📌 Boards play a critical role in overseeing an effective risk management process that permeates an organization, minimizing liabilities and maximizing opportunities. &#13;
&#13;
Board oversight is key to ensuring that management is accountable for risks facing the organization and is designing a strategy that aligns the appropriate degrees of acceptable risk with organizational goals and objectives. Risk conversations, as a dedicated part of every board meeting agenda, should consider the following questions shown in the picture.&#13;

&#13;
A recent study by Deloitte found that the manufacturing industry will have to fill 𝟰.𝟲 𝗺𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗷𝗼𝗯𝘀 𝗯𝗲𝘁𝘄𝗲𝗲𝗻 𝟮𝟬𝟭𝟴-𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟴, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝗶𝘁 𝘄𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗼𝗻𝗹𝘆 𝗯𝗲 𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗳𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝟮.𝟮 𝗺𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗼𝗻, or half of them.&#13;
&#13;
One way to bridge the gap is through in-house technical training. Skills training programs help employees adopt and employ digital technologies that allow them to get more tasks done in less time each day. This trend, called digital transformation, enables manufacturers to move their organizations into Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 includes incorporating digital transformation, the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, artificial intelligence, mobile technologies, machine learning, smart factories, analytics, and other advanced technologies into the business – right down to the production line.&#13;
&#13;
Major manufacturers are undertaking massive digitization projects to augment their production processes; however, small companies with limited resources can still digitize their operations by taking simpler, cost-effective steps. The solution for small and medium-sized manufacturing companies is simple: 𝗹𝗼𝘄-𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗲/𝗻𝗼-𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝘀𝗼𝗳𝘁𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲. This software can be used by manufacturing employees to build apps to serve quality teams. Employees can build a custom mobile app based on their process or workflow without having to code at all or employing additional app development resources.&#13;

1. Reduce, &#13;
2. Refurbish/Reuse, &#13;
3. Recycle and &#13;
4. Recover. &#13;
   &#13;
Each of the four Rs contributes to sustainable manufacturing. However, their relevance for CE, impact on the current manufacturing strategy and ease of implementation vary. Moreover, the level of impact and applicability is industry-specific.&#13;
&#13;
Challenges and opportunities are likely to vary significantly from one industry to another. Individual assessments and concepts are necessary as there is no one-size-fits-all solution to CE across the manufacturing industry.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
It’s estimated that nearly every aspect of work will be optimized by data by 2025—and organizations able to make the most progress fastest stand to capture the highest value. Companies that embrace digital technologies and harness the power of data already have the upper hand when it comes to decision-making, problem-solving, employee satisfaction, and performance.&#13;
&#13;
Those able to make the most progress fastest stand to capture the highest value from data-supported capabilities. Companies already seeing 20 percent of their earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) contributed by artificial intelligence (AI), for example, are far more likely to engage in data practices.&#13;
&#13;
According to McKinsey &amp; Company, seven characteristics will define this new data-driven enterprise:&#13;
1. Data embedded in every decision, interaction, and process&#13;
2. Data is processed and delivered in real time&#13;
3. Flexible data stores enable integrated, ready-to-use data&#13;
4. Data operating model treats data like a product&#13;
5. The chief data officer’s role is expanded to generate value&#13;
6. Data-ecosystem memberships are the norm&#13;
7. Data management is prioritized and automated for privacy, security, and resiliency&#13;

Neki problemi su nevidljivi, a neki bodu oči. Identifikovanje problema, kao i njihovih rešenja je nekad lakše uz pomoć ljudi sa strane. Zato je Centar za Digitalnu Transformaciju (CDT) kreirao program podrške kompanijama da digitalizuju svoje poslovanje ali pre toga da uvide gde i kako na najbezbolniji način poboljšati poslovanje kompanije. &#13;
&#13;
CDT pri Privredna komora Srbije | Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Serbia zatvara uskoro prijavu kompanija na program podrške kompanijama koja žele da se unaprede u digitalnom poslovanju. &#13;
&#13;
Program 2022 se zatvara 31.12.2022. i ostalo je još samo par dana da se kompanije prijave. Program obuhvata stručnu pomoć od strane konsultanata ali i značajnu finansijsku pomoć za implementaciju rešenja. &#13;

&#13;
Blockchains are driven by consensus. When a user initiates a transaction, its details are broadcast to the entire network, checked by other users and accepted if there is consensus. Once a transaction has been validated, it’s bundled with other transactions into a block of data.&#13;
&#13;
Each block is secured via a cryptographic algorithm.This results in a unique signature for each block known as a hash. These blocks are then ordered sequentially into a chain of blocks, with each block also containing the previous block’s hash. This makes it extremely difficult to tamper with a block, as altering a single piece of data would result in a different hash value, making it evident to the blockchain’s users and causing the transaction to be rejected.&#13;
&#13;
Some parts of this process can be done automatically with smart contracts. These involve two entities turning a business contract into code that recognizes actions on the blockchain. For example, a smart contract might recognize that a sale of an asset by “Company A” to “Company B” on a certain date should be for a specific price. This simplifies processes that take significant time to check. &#13;
&#13;
This structure gives network participants confidence in their transaction without the need to trust each other.&#13;

Remember, while technology evolves, there are timeless human skills that remain invaluable. 🌟You can still have a fulfilling, exciting, and even imaginative career. However, to excel and stand out among your peers, you must learn to harness these new tools and develop three skills that machines cannot replace.&#13;
&#13;
Curiosity: Don't allow AI to make you dull, biased, predictable, or close-minded. Stay curious and take the time to discover how you can delegate mundane tasks to AI. But don't fall into a routine driven by AI. Use AI tools to inspire you and pique your curiosity about the world beyond them.&#13;
&#13;
Humility: Don't let AI erode your self-awareness. Begin by understanding who you are. Ask yourself: Which behaviours come naturally to me? What motivates me? What hinders me? Then, seek feedback from others. AI is adept at adapting and accepting feedback, and so should you. Ask others for suggestions on what you should start, stop, and continue doing.&#13;
&#13;
Emotional Intelligence: Don't forget your humanity. Your ability to forge connections, demonstrate empathy, and communicate effectively (your emotional intelligence) is more crucial than ever. Before expressing an opinion or making a decision, pause and consider your teammates. Are you serving the team's objectives or your own? To avoid conflict, be especially mindful when communicating digitally. Digital communication often leads to impulsive, cold, and unsociable interactions, resulting in conflict.&#13;
&#13;
Embrace the future by melding the power of AI with your innate human qualities. In the digital age, it's not just about using the right tools; it's about combining them with the right mindset and emotional approach. Step into the future with confidence, armed with skills that AI can't replicate. 💪&#13;

Any change can be frightening, but keeping up with advances can be especially so. Part of the challenge is determining which improvements are the most significant and which are less likely to bear fruit.&#13;
&#13;
These are the top ten innovations drawing the interest and funding of investors and technologists. They are also the ones who will be most visible in the shifting face of the modern workplace. Understanding the impact of these technological trends on businesses and the individuals whose jobs will be affected could be critical to averting the worst consequences of the disruption that may ensue.&#13;

&#13;
📌𝗙𝗼𝗿 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻, 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿 𝘁𝗼 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗔𝗜 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘁𝗼 𝗱𝗼 𝗶𝘁. &#13;
 &#13;
Here are some actionable strategies for decision-makers who are eager to harness AI's potential with confidence:&#13;
&#13;
1️⃣ Identify AI's potential: Pinpoint the areas where AI can make the most significant and immediate impact. Without a clear business case, ROI, and urgency, efforts might falter. Whether it is improving safety protocols or enhancing talent retention, it is crucial to determine where AI can benefit your firm the most given its digital maturity.&#13;
&#13;
2️⃣ Invest in R&amp;D: The E&amp;C industry invests only 1% in technology, lagging behind other sectors like finance and manufacturing. However, AI thrives on data, and without digitization, its potential remains untapped. 𝙎𝙪𝙘𝙘𝙚𝙨𝙨𝙛𝙪𝙡 𝙙𝙞𝙜𝙞𝙩𝙞𝙯𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙗𝙤𝙤𝙨𝙩 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙘𝙝𝙖𝙣𝙘𝙚𝙨 𝙤𝙛 𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙥𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝘼𝙄'𝙨 𝙥𝙧𝙤𝙛𝙞𝙩𝙨 𝙗𝙮 𝙖 𝙨𝙩𝙖𝙜𝙜𝙚𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝟱𝟬%.&#13;
&#13;
3️⃣ Think beyond your industry: The E&amp;C sector's insular approach is outdated, and today, it's about ecosystem thinking. Leaders must explore partnerships beyond industry confines. Collaborations with startups, universities, or AI-driven sectors can offer fresh perspectives and innovative solutions.&#13;
&#13;
4️⃣ Transform your talent: The talent landscape is changing, and the industry needs to break its trend of under-investing in talent development. The focus should be on attracting AI and digital experts from diverse sectors and upskilling existing talent. A workforce fluent in machine learning and digital concepts is indispensable in this digital age.&#13;
&#13;
5️⃣ Revolutionize internal processes with AI: The C-suite must drive process innovation and foster a culture that embraces AI-driven change. The power to implement AI solutions should not be confined to mid-management.&#13;
&#13;
6️⃣ Be an early adopter: The benefits of AI are ripe for the taking, and those who act swiftly will lead the industry's transformation. While the E&amp;C sector may have been a tech-adoption laggard historically, the moment to break the mold is now. Leaders must seize this opportunity, ensuring their firms remain at the forefront of AI integration.&#13;
&#13;
The AI revolution is already underway, and construction leaders have a choice to make: either shape the future or be shaped by it. By embracing these strategies with confidence, leading the charge, and harnessing the transformative power of AI, leaders can mold the future of the construction sector. The future is in their hands.&#13;

The reason behind this belief lies in the constant evolution of technology, customer needs, and market dynamics. To remain competitive, businesses need to consistently embrace and adapt to new technologies, tools, and processes. &#13;
&#13;
One of the key reasons why digital transformation is a journey is the rapid growth and evolution of innovative technologies, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data, and cloud computing. These technologies change the way businesses interact with their customers, manage operations, and drive innovation. Companies need to be constantly updating their strategies to keep up with shifts in technological advancements.&#13;
&#13;
An important aspect of the journey is that digital transformation is not just about technology; it's also about culture and mindset. Transitioning into a digital-first business model requires a shift in how employees think, work, and collaborate. Emphasizing continuous learning, encouraging innovation, and adopting agile thinking is essential for fostering a successful digital culture within the organization. &#13;
&#13;
Continuously changing customer expectations are fueling the rise of digital platforms, streamlined experiences, and the need for personalized services. Therefore, companies must keep the customer at the centre of their digital transformation efforts, constantly evolving to meet and exceed their customers' expectations.&#13;
&#13;
Even if companies succeed in implementing the latest technology, they need to be prepared to adapt quickly to future changes. Making digital transformation an ongoing journey helps ensure that organizations remain competitive, agile, and customer-centric.&#13;

Many organizations have a digital strategy, but they struggle to communicate effectively across functions, hindering their ability to transform digitally and address related opportunities and risks. &#13;
&#13;
Having a common language for digital transformation can empower C-suite executives to have meaningful conversations that go beyond individual technologies, and focus on processes, culture, and interactions.&#13;
&#13;
By adopting a common language, organizations can:&#13;
&#13;
• Overcome barriers caused by human behaviour and structure. Interconnected elements of an organization can be addressed thematically, avoiding redundant investments, and scaling up changes by improving communication.&#13;
• Plan beyond a single technology. Platforms, capabilities, and initiatives often involve multiple digital and physical technologies working together. As technologies combine, they bring new capabilities and greater value.&#13;
• Adapt to future changes. Today's breakthrough technology will become tomorrow's legacy tech. A common language enables leaders to think flexibly and align business and technology needs without relying on a single technology.&#13;
• Achieve greater strategic business value. This approach helps organizations align and execute their business strategy to achieve desired results and adaptability of the organization, humans, and technology.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Digital transformation can be described as business transformation using digital capabilities. In other words, it’s more than just adopting technology for technology’s sake. There are four common paths to digital transformation. For some companies, it makes sense to choose more than one.&#13;
&#13;
🎯 The researchers found that transformation must happen in two ways: better customer experience and improved operational efficiency. Firms can make progress on one, both, or neither, and they typically take four different pathways to transformation:&#13;
&#13;
1. focus on transforming operations, which commonly means building new business services enabled by application programming interfaces (APIs).&#13;
&#13;
2. focus on an integrated customer experience if metrics such as net promoter score fall well below the industry average&#13;
&#13;
3. take incremental steps in each direction over several iterations, starting with a small step to improve the customer experience (such as a new mobile app) and following that with a small step to streamline operations (such as a new customer relationship management system).&#13;
&#13;
4. starting fresh with a spinoff company — an option if leaders of the current company don’t think it’s possible to change culture, customer experience, and operations fast enough to survive.&#13;
&#13;
Pathways suited to one business unit might not work for another, and sometimes it makes sense to pursue multiple pathways. One part of the business may need an immediate improvement to customer service, while another may have more latitude to take incremental steps.&#13;

This is the world of Industry 4.0, where data is collected and analyzed in real time, and logistics operations are optimized for efficiency and cost-effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
Take, for example, BMW Group which implemented Industry 4.0 technologies in their supply chain. They were able to track the movement of goods and materials in real time and adjust their logistics operations on the fly. This resulted in improved delivery times, increased efficiency, and a 20% reduction in costs.&#13;
&#13;
These are just a few examples of how Industry 4.0 is driving the future of manufacturing logistics. With the integration of advanced technologies, manufacturers can now predict and prevent maintenance issues, optimize logistics and reduce costs all while improving customer satisfaction.&#13;
&#13;
As we move further into the digital age, it's clear that Industry 4.0 is the key to unlocking a smarter, more efficient future for manufacturing logistics. The future is here, and it's time for manufacturers to embrace it.&#13;

Roland Berger's recent study on this topic highlights that manufacturing businesses need to go beyond cost-cutting measures and consider other important factors such as sustainability, risk management, supply chain governance, and company values to remain competitive. This shift in manufacturing was inevitable and necessary, given the climate crisis, global supply chain obstacles, and humanitarian issues in outsourcing.&#13;
&#13;
However, this change also presents an opportunity for manufacturers to turn their liabilities into assets and gain a competitive edge by reevaluating their manufacturing strategies. Next-generation manufacturing presents six megatrends that forward-thinking businesses can leverage to turn their manufacturing into a value generator once again. These six megatrends include sustainability, localization, populism, industry disruption, mass customization, and digitalization.&#13;
&#13;
Each of these megatrends provides an opportunity for manufacturers to rethink their business models and create new value for their customers. The strength of these trends will vary from region to region, and companies need to adapt their strategies to meet these different demands. &#13;

&#13;
Even the most robust supply chain has a few weak links. Maybe yours are concentrated upstream, with small manufacturers that suffer from quality-control issues, or downstream, with retailers that have trouble getting products into customers’ hands-on time. Either way, you may be able to bolster those links—or forge some alternatives—with the help of additive manufacturing.&#13;
&#13;
Consider an industrial product manufacturer with a customer who needs a particular low-demand service part immediately, and can’t wait for shipping from a central warehouse or, worse, for fabrication by some remote supplier. If a dealer could simply “print” a new component on the spot, that customer could be served far more efficiently and effectively.&#13;
&#13;
Or think of what now happens when an obscure machine part breaks at a remotely located factory: While waiting for trains and trucks to deliver a replacement, operations leadership must devise workarounds or let the shop floor sit idle. An on-site 3D printer might fabricate a new part and enable barely a pause in productivity—potentially saving thousands or tens of thousands of dollars per hour in facility downtime and the company credibility.&#13;
&#13;
⚡Using additive manufacturing technologies to evolve supply chains can offer companies substantial value and a competitive advantage. Some potential benefits could be from lowering costs and risks to greater flexibility and agility.&#13;

Executives in every industry know that data is important. Without it, there can be no digital transformation to propel the organization past competitors. There are no analytics driving new sources of revenue. Even running the basic business well isn’t possible. But for data to fuel these initiatives, it must be readily available, of high quality, and relevant. Good data governance ensures data has these attributes, which enable it to create value.&#13;
&#13;
The problem is that most governance programs today are ineffective. The issue frequently starts at the top, with a C-suite that doesn’t recognize the value-creation potential in data governance. As a result, it becomes a set of policies and guidance relegated to a support function executed by IT and not widely followed—rendering the initiatives that data powers equally ineffective. In other cases, organizations try to use technology to solve the problem. While technology solutions such as data lakes and data-governance platforms can help, they aren’t a panacea.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
"The adoption of innovation means an innovation has ceased to be “innovative.” It means that a method, technology, or approach to a problem has moved from the experimental edges of an organization to the core of its work: no longer a novelty, but something normal and institutionalized.&#13;
&#13;
However, the concept of adoption is rarely discussed, and the experience and know-how to bring it about is even less common. While an increasing evidence base has been developed on adopting digital systems in development and public sector organizations, as well as literature on organizational reform, little has been published on strategically moving approaches and technologies out of the innovation space to the mainstream of how organizations work. The most relevant insights come from institutionalizing behavioural insights in governments, mainly in public sector entities in the global north. This gap makes it all the more important to surface the challenges, opportunities, and factors that enable adoption, as well as the barriers and roadblocks that impede it."&#13;

&#13;
For companies around the world, the information age presents a double-edged sword.&#13;
&#13;
On one hand, all this data can be 𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲𝗹𝘆 𝗶𝗻𝘃𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗼𝗿 𝗱𝗲𝗰𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀. However, with data growing at exponential rates, this also means that there is a lot of noise – and finding the right signal can be like looking for a needle in a haystack.&#13;
&#13;
📌Predictive analytics is defined as: “The branch of advanced analytics used to make predictions about unknown future events. It uses techniques from data mining, statistics, modelling, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to make predictions about the future.”&#13;
&#13;
This kind of predictive power is already widely used by companies like Amazon, which uses algorithms to sort through billions of data points, your buying history, and current trends to recommend to you the items that you are most likely to buy. In fact, experts estimate that 35% of Amazon’s revenue comes from this practice of anticipating exactly what you want.&#13;
&#13;
⚡But there is one possible limitation with these approaches. Markets are complex systems and need to be analysed as such. After all, human decision makers can be irrational, events can be “triggered” by seemingly random factors, and traditional mathematical models can fall apart when markets get volatile.&#13;

&#13;
Low-Code/No-Code (LCNC) technologies are igniting a “Cambrian” explosion of user-generated innovation. This innovation in LCNC can empower and enable small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to address their business needs – from innovation to operations – in an accelerated manner.&#13;
&#13;
🎯Three factors make LCNC extremely relevant for SMBs in today’s business environment:&#13;
1. Digital maturity as a competitive necessity&#13;
2. Challenging access to digital talent&#13;
3. Enterprise IT solutions don’t meet SMB needs&#13;

In the article by Strategyzer on ROI for innovation it's been discussed that leaders need to understand the difference between the Explore and Exploit worlds of decision-making and allocate resources accordingly.&#13;
&#13;
The Exploit world is where the current successful business operates, with low uncertainty and clear ROI calculations. Also, innovation is about improving and growing the existing business.&#13;
&#13;
The Explore world is where new value propositions and business models are tested, with high uncertainty and no reliable ROI data. In this world, leaders need to use metered funding and evaluate the return on the portfolio, not individual projects.&#13;
&#13;
Leaders are also interested in the time horizon for getting returns from their investments in innovation. In general, the time horizons for Exploit projects are faster than the time horizons for Explore projects.&#13;
&#13;
Efficiency innovation is about doing more with less, sustaining innovation is about making better products for existing customers, and transformative innovation is about creating new markets and customers. Each type of innovation has different implications for growth, profitability, and competitiveness. &#13;

&#13;
Since 2018, the World Economic Forum, in collaboration with McKinsey &amp; Company has sought to recognize, encourage, and accelerate the at-scale digital transformation of manufacturing by launching what is now called the Global Lighthouse Network (GLN).&#13;
The GLN has become a community of manufacturers leading the way in the use of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies. The GLN’s 103 members, including manufacturers and other organizations along the value chain, represent a diverse range of industries that span the planet and generate a wealth of insights on achieving 4IR transformation.&#13;
&#13;
In the current geopolitical context, local manufacturing and supply chain resilience are becoming increasingly important. At the same time, organizations face new obstacles as they strive to engage their workforces and sustain operations amid international unrest and economic headwinds. Furthermore, there are new pressures related to the need to maintain sustainability commitments and accelerate the transition toward renewable energy, while addressing more immediate energy market disruptions. These concurrent challenges call for #innovation, leadership, and inspiration—indeed, manufacturers need a playbook now more than ever to guide responsible industry transformation.&#13;
&#13;
💡The initial idea, four years ago, was that embracing digital technologies and new working modes would enable an evolution in manufacturing. Today, the GLN has made a compelling case for the ability of 4IR technology to boost productivity, growth, and sustainability.&#13;

Small businesses contribute to half of the global GDP and two-thirds of the global workforce.&#13;
&#13;
However, small businesses' ability to compete is under rising pressure from rapidly changing market conditions and evolving technologies, with 86% of small businesses strongly agreeing that “technology is changing the industry”. &#13;
&#13;
Small businesses seek the right partners to overcome their digitalization challenges. First. they often look internally for a suitable skill set, knowledge and experience to start the digital transformation efforts. &#13;
&#13;
Do you think this would work?&#13;
&#13;
Well, it depends. Usually, such efforts are best supported by external partners specialized in dealing with these kinds of projects and initiatives.&#13;

&#13;
Perhaps your company needs to cut costs, increase margins, or reinvest. Or perhaps your company is still trying to expand. Maybe it's time for a pivot — to reinvent the business model. Some people may need to do all of these things at once.&#13;
&#13;
Business leaders and technologists should evaluate the potential impact of these trends on their specific strategies, as each one may represent a risk or an opportunity for your company.&#13;
&#13;
Gartner has created a list of trends that expect to impact enterprise strategies in the coming three years by enabling organizations to address four key priorities:&#13;
•	𝗢𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗶𝗻𝗴 resilience, operations or trust&#13;
•	𝗦𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 vertical solutions, product delivery or everywhere&#13;
•	𝗣𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 customer engagement, accelerated responses or opportunity&#13;
•	Pursuing 𝘀𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝘆 solutions&#13;
&#13;
Whether you need to optimise, scale, or pioneer — or figure out how to do so sustainably — analysing these trends will help you develop a technology roadmap that will have an impact on a variety of strategic goals, such as increasing revenue, accelerating digital, maximising value from data, or protecting and building your brand.&#13;

But does it belong in your business? That depends.&#13;
&#13;
There’s little argument that AI offers companies plenty of capabilities and opportunities, and most executives know it. When polled by PwC, 86% of professionals said AI was a fairly established part of corporate life. Yet even if it’s mainstream, AI shouldn’t be treated as just another tool.&#13;
&#13;
To get the most out of AI, you have to understand it first so you can deploy it strategically in the way that makes the most sense for you, your team, and your goals. Ultimately, you’ll optimize your spending and get the most out of every solution and system you bring into your organization. The following steps will help you figure out how to bring AI into your fold.&#13;
&#13;
1. Conduct research on AI’s strengths and limitations.&#13;
2. Start with small AI experiments.&#13;
3. Tie AI into specific objectives.&#13;
4. Set aside time for employee training.&#13;

Many transformations fail due to the high level of change resistance among stakeholders. This is a common challenge for digital transformation initiatives, as Forrester’s Business And Technology Services Survey, 2022 reveals. The survey found that 21% of global services decision-makers supporting their organization’s digital transformation faced difficulties in implementing new processes and capabilities.&#13;
&#13;
To overcome this challenge, organizations need to adopt effective change management strategies. However, Forrester’s research indicates that traditional change management approaches are not sufficient to address the complexity and scale of change resistance in digital transformation.&#13;

Are you truly aware of your factory's capabilities?&#13;
🔗 The shift toward Industry 4.0 is unearthing what I like to call the "Hidden Factory"—areas and assets in your facility that hold untapped value.&#13;
&#13;
The trick? 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗶𝘁𝘆.&#13;
💡 When disparate assets and data across multiple platforms are connected, the floodgates open to actionable insights.&#13;
&#13;
📈 Not only does this shed light on areas you may have overlooked, but it also accelerates decision-making. As organizations digitally transform, the nuanced view into the factory floor—made possible by intelligent systems—enables leaders to fine-tune strategies in real-time.&#13;
&#13;
🤔 If you're looking to discover what's been "hidden" in your operations, perhaps we should talk further.&#13;

&#13;
An example of banks and start-ups is explained but applicable to any industry and region.&#13;
&#13;
When developing an innovative product or a service (or both) big organizations should take this into account and one of the possible ways is to create such teams internally or better (and more efficient) to establish a new company with a different culture and approach.&#13;

This kind of predictive power is already widely used by companies like Amazon, which uses algorithms to sort through billions of data points, your buying history, and current trends to recommend to you the items that you are most likely to buy. &#13;
&#13;
In fact, experts estimate that 35% of Amazon’s revenue comes from this practice of anticipating exactly what you want.&#13;

They often get stuck in pilot mode, where they test new ideas but fail to deliver value. To move beyond pilot mode, they need to align their vision, strategy and execution, adopt agile practices and culture, automate their processes and workflows, and use analytics to measure and improve their performance. &#13;
&#13;
According to McKinsey, more than 𝟲𝟬% 𝗼𝗳 𝗼𝗿𝗴𝗮𝗻𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝘄𝗵𝗼𝘀𝗲 𝗱𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗱 "𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗯𝘂𝘁𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺 𝘁𝗼 𝗳𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁—𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝗰𝗶𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗰𝘂𝘀—𝗼𝗿𝗴𝗮𝗻𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗹 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗻𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗲𝗱𝗶𝘂𝗺 𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺.&#13;
&#13;
There are several factors hindering momentum and holding back organizations from fully realizing their digital transformation efforts. Many companies, for example, lack a clear focus on specific outcomes, along with securing widespread buy-in toward a shared goal, both of which are vital to successful digital transformation. Other challenges include:&#13;
&#13;
• Data silos&#13;
• Lack of coordination across business units&#13;
• Lack of proper technical experience&#13;
• Lack of integrated planning and execution&#13;

That means its “organizational hardware” (i.e., structures, processes, technologies, and governance) and its “organizational software” (i.e., values, norms, culture, leadership, and employee skills and aspirations) must be designed exclusively in the service of a specific strategy. &#13;
&#13;
Research by HBR suggests that only 10% of organizations are successful at aligning their strategy with their organization design. Some of the problems is a gross misunderstanding of what the word “alignment” actually means in this context. When it comes to executing strategy, alignment means configuring all of the organization’s assets in the service of your stated strategy and making sure there is no confusion about what each part of the organization does to bring it to life. &#13;

Fortunately, the potential applications of AI in business are practically limitless. Nevertheless, given that decisions made in one area of an organization have the potential to affect other areas, the introduction of AI frequently necessitates the overhaul of entire systems. In this sense, AI is comparable to other revolutionary technologies of the past, such as electricity, which was initially restricted to narrow applications but eventually transformed the manufacturing industry.&#13;
&#13;
Decision-making entails a combination of forecasting and judgment, and since AI is capable of making highly accurate predictions, it has the potential to shift the authority to make decisions towards the area where judgment is still required. This may alter who makes decisions and the time, place and manner in which they are made. The enhanced precision of predictions in one aspect of a value chain will also have a knock-on effect on other aspects. For example, if a manufacturer can accurately predict the resource types and quantities it will require each week/month, this will cause its orders to fluctuate, creating greater uncertainty in the sales of its suppliers. Effective communication is essential to coordinate efforts and resources within a system, and modularization can assist in preventing changes in one area from disrupting others.&#13;

Industry 4.0 collects and analyses data using sensor technologies, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.&#13;
The advantages are reduced production downtime, improved product quality, and proactive maintenance.&#13;
&#13;
However, significant constraints like as legacy operations and a failure to adequately engage frontline workers in operational redesign frequently stymie such large-scale reform.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Sensor networks are the backbone for generating feedback loops to uncover hidden factories, the poorly understood processes and workarounds that drive up production costs and slow systems down.&#13;
&#13;
However, as firms implement Industry 4.0, they frequently wind up acquiring data at a much faster rate than it can be used.&#13;
&#13;
Despite investments in new technologies and business process innovations, the most significant hurdles to Industry 4.0 transformation are operational practices and old mindsets that keep employees anchored to familiar work patterns.&#13;
&#13;
One of the primary issues is a 𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗼𝗳 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗿𝗱𝗶𝘀𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻. The traditional working modes have too many variations, making it challenging to identify the business processes and workflows that will decrease company risk and boost productivity.&#13;
&#13;
𝗚𝗵𝗼𝘀𝘁𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗼𝗹𝗱 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗲𝘀. When new technologies and ways of working create a challenge, some people will revert to the status quo. When pushed under duress, employees will resort to the old system until they gain confidence in the new technology. Value does not become apparent until the old ways of doing things are phased out.&#13;
&#13;
𝗜𝗻𝘀𝘂𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻. Companies that invest in cutting-edge sensors and software frequently underestimate the level of worker training required to use those tools to improve maintenance and diagnostics. Capital-intensive systems necessitate additional preparation; the level of preparation and training should be proportional to the machinery's complexity.&#13;

⚡What was discovered by Deloitte, is that a process is linear and intuitive, but also tedious and often fraught with pitfalls. Fortunately, the process seems adaptable for manufacturers of all sizes, and risks can be partially mitigated by planning and prioritizing the investments.&#13;
&#13;
When probed about the business reasons influencing smart factories, the research respondents identified concrete business outcomes. Specifically, they selected:&#13;
1. improved production capacity, &#13;
2. increased throughput, &#13;
3. greater visibility into asset performance and &#13;
4. enhanced product/part quality &#13;
   &#13;
   as the key reason to start or expand initiatives. So a business case with a pointed outcome is a must-have.&#13;
&#13;
However, the leaders in the market who have gone through this process had multiple approaches and not just one tried-and-true path. Multiple approaches allowed them to test more options; if one approach flops, another will work and give greater results.&#13;
Starting small with POC and scaling them can work in the smart factory domain. The same survey suggests that leaders had 50 to 70 small use cases running across the different plants simultaneously.&#13;

As a result, they often make only ad hoc changes and investments in the digital arena, with ineffectual results. The challenge, to which most companies have yet to rise, is figuring out how to fully capture the different kinds of value that these technologies offer. Developing a strategy for digital transformation that fully leverages this value is also not easy. Without a comprehensive assessment of what digital technologies can offer, firms tend to assume that any application of modern digital technologies will lead to a digital transformation.&#13;
&#13;
Defined by Harvard Business Review there are four distinct tiers of digital transformation, each of which meets different strategic objectives and allows companies to maximize the value they capture from digital technologies:&#13;
&#13;
1. Tier One: Operational efficiencies&#13;
2. Tier Two: Advanced operational efficiencies&#13;
3. Tier Three: Data-driven services from value chains&#13;
4. Tier Four: Data-driven services from digital platforms&#13;
&#13;
To think properly about these four tiers of transformation, the first step is to recognize that modern digital technologies have two notable value drivers: data in its new expansive role, and emergent digital ecosystems.&#13;
&#13;
Data used to be episodic (generated by discrete events such as the shipment of a component from a supplier), but increasingly it is becoming interactive (generated continuously by sensors and the IoT to track information).  Two main kinds of digital ecosystems have emerged, neither of which existed before modern advances in data and digital connectivity. One kind is the production ecosystem, which encompasses digital linkages within value chains. By linking sensor and IoT data from cars to spare-part suppliers, warehouses, and service dealers, for example, car companies can offer predictive maintenance services. The other kind is the consumption ecosystem, which involves networks outside of a firm’s value chain. &#13;

🌊 Diving into the Blue Ocean Strategy 🌊&#13;
&#13;
In a highly competitive world where markets are saturated, businesses are often stuck in what is called the "Red Ocean." This is where companies try to outdo each other, resulting in fierce competition, reduced margins, and commoditized offerings.&#13;
&#13;
However, the #blueoceanstrategy offers a new approach. It challenges businesses to move beyond competing in existing market space and instead focus on creating uncontested market space. This strategy makes competition irrelevant by emphasizing the need to be different and unique, rather than simply being better.&#13;
&#13;
When it comes to staying ahead in business, it's important to focus on creating value for customers in innovative ways rather than just trying to beat the competition. This means finding ways to both differentiate your product and keep costs low. It's also important to think outside of the current industry constraints and redefine market boundaries. &#13;
&#13;
This approach, known as the 𝗕𝗹𝘂𝗲 𝗢𝗰𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝘆, has been proven effective by companies like Cirque Du Soleil, Apple, and Netflix. By embracing this strategy, they were able to deliver unprecedented value to their customers and avoid cutthroat competition, allowing them to thrive in expansive blue waters.&#13;
&#13;
Are you ready to navigate your organization into the blue ocean? 🌊&#13;

&#13;
 This largely reflects the fact that Europe missed the boat on the last technology revolution, lagging behind on value and growth in information and communications technology (ICT) and on other disruptive innovations.&#13;
&#13;
Europe’s lack of scale in transversal technologies jeopardizes its position in nearly all sectors, including current strongholds like automotive and luxury goods.&#13;
&#13;
The fact that Europe did not keep pace with the United States in the first technology wave centred on the internet and software now means that Europe is in a weakened position in transversal technologies across sectors. Our analysis looks at ten such transversal technologies on which Europe’s future performance and prosperity hinge. Europe leads on only two of the ten.&#13;

This helped a little to imagine the place, the magnificent history made there, yet it was still missing something more. &#13;
&#13;
It came to my mind that with technology this experience can be immersive and even better. With a great #AR app, which everyone can have on their phone, tourists can really have a great visual of the place, with real-time rendering, location identification, information shows etc.&#13;

According to Accenture, data-driven companies are propelled by four key drivers. They:&#13;
&#13;
1. Establish a solid data foundation: Achieved through an agile data supply chain with cloud-based and scalable platforms. &#13;
   &#13;
2. Ensure data is secure, relevant and trustworthy: Accomplished through robust data governance, metadata management and data veracity solutions. This is enabled by machine learning (ML) or artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, right people structures and processes. Only a third of firms trusted their data enough to use it effectively and derive value from it.&#13;
   &#13;
3. Create an analytics strategy: Attained by focusing on augmenting human efforts with AI and by building capabilities in advanced analytics. Almost 90 per cent of data-driven champions in the survey could attest to being highly involved in data analytics processes and automated approaches as opposed to 54 per cent of others.&#13;
   &#13;
4. Envision and launch new data-driven services: Realized through innovative business models and operational efficiency measures. Using a data value scorecard, business outcomes can be measured, tracked and reported effectively.&#13;
&#13;
To transition from data doubt to data dominance, you need more than just technology—you need a transformation. &#13;

This problem is the lack of an effective “method” — a systematic or established procedure to undertake something, step by step. But methods can be learned. A 6-step method introduced in Harvard Business Review:&#13;
&#13;
1. recognize your dependencies, i.e. your key stakeholders&#13;
2.  identify your “target customer” &#13;
3. define what your organization wants from each key stakeholder group for your organization to prosper&#13;

&#13;
The GII 2022 tracks global innovation trends against the background of an ongoing pandemic, a slowing of productivity growth and other evolving challenges.&#13;
&#13;
The main findings this year are as follows:&#13;
1. Contrary to what historic evidence would suggest, science and innovation investments were thriving at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and boomed in 2021, but their continued resilience is uncertain for 2022 in the face of new challenges.&#13;
   &#13;
2. The indicators of technological progress in the fields of semiconductor speeds, electric battery prices, the cost of renewable energy (with the exception of wind) and drug approvals show a significant slowdown from long-term trends and even a decline in the case of drug approvals.&#13;
   &#13;
3. Technology adoption is progressing, with positive growth rates across technologies measured by the Global Innovation Tracker, in particular for electric vehicles. However, penetration rates are still medium to low, with the exception of mobile broadband, which reaches the vast majority of the global population.&#13;
   &#13;
4. Largely due to the short-term influences of the COVID-19 pandemic, the socioeconomic impact of innovation seems to be at a low point, with labour productivity and life expectancy experiencing a significant slowdown if not coming to a complete standstill, and in the case of carbon dioxide emissions, failing to show ongoing reductions in pollution.&#13;

To understand which approach you’ll need to take, ask yourself two questions:&#13;
&#13;
1. Is your transformation driven by internal needs or external forces?&#13;
2. Does it need to happen quickly, or do you have more time to transform?&#13;
&#13;
Business transformations vary in terms of content, pace, and place of initiation — and it’s rare that companies are only undergoing one at a time. Doing business today means navigating a complex landscape of interconnected and interdependent issues, each having multiple stakeholders and agendas. Hence, organizations need to understand the various types of transformations, and know how to manage each.&#13;

Based on research conducted by McKinsey, there are four core actions that are especially predictive of transformations that capture the most value:&#13;
&#13;
1. 𝗨𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗻 𝗼𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗳𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗳𝘆 𝗼𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁. Organizations that thoroughly use facts to assess the maximum financial benefit from a transformation are more likely to pursue ambitious yet realistic targets that reflect the transformation's full potential. This action enables leaders to have more confidence in their decisions.&#13;
   &#13;
2. 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝘂𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗼𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝘄𝗵𝘆 𝗮 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝘀 𝗻𝗲𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗮𝗿𝘆. Leaders need to explain why employees should do things differently. If people don't understand what transformation means for their daily work and overall business goals, their mindsets and behaviour won't change, and organizational health will suffer. Role modelling, developing talent and skills, and fostering understanding and conviction are ways to ensure that people are brought on board and stay there.&#13;
   &#13;
3. 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝘆'𝘀 𝗯𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗶𝘁𝘀 𝗺𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗰𝗿𝘂𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲𝘀. This action emphasizes the importance of linking business and talent priorities by creating a clear view of where value is generated in the company and who in the organization has the ability to deliver that value.&#13;
   &#13;
4. 𝗘𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗱𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝗰𝗶𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀-𝗮𝘀-𝘂𝘀𝘂𝗮𝗹 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀, 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺𝘀. The research shows that the execution stage is key to generating value. Companies that have undergone successful transformations are more likely than others to have made substantial changes to their annual business planning processes and review cycles, from executive-level weekly briefings and monthly or quarterly reviews to individual performance dialogues.&#13;

They believe that to create new markets and value, they have to destroy existing ones. But this is not always the case. In fact, there is another way of innovating that is often overlooked: 𝗻𝗼𝗻𝗱𝗶𝘀𝗿𝘂𝗽𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝗻𝗼𝘃𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻. &#13;
&#13;
This is the idea behind the Blue Ocean Strategy, a strategic framework that helps to create uncontested market spaces where competition is irrelevant. Nondisruptive creation does not harm or replace existing industries or jobs. Instead, it creates new ones where none existed before. It expands the economic pie for everyone, benefiting both business and society. This is the kind of innovation that we need more of in today’s world. &#13;

Digital ecosystems are not a new concept, but they are evolving rapidly thanks to the convergence of technologies such as IoT, edge computing, 5G, and cloud. &#13;
&#13;
These technologies enable the development of digital twins, which are virtual representations of physical assets, processes, and/or systems. There are a lot of use cases of Digital twins for every industry. &#13;
&#13;
They can be used to monitor, optimize, and control complex systems across different domains and industries, like in:&#13;
&#13;
• 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Imagine a digital twin of a railway system that can optimize the operations, maintenance, and safety of trains, tracks, and stations.&#13;
• 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗼𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲: Having a connected vehicle fleet that can communicate with each other, the infrastructure, and the cloud to provide enhanced services, such as autonomous driving, smart parking, and personalized entertainment.&#13;
• 𝗟𝗼𝗴𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰𝘀: Imagine a connected logistics hub that can streamline the flow of goods and people, reduce costs and emissions, and improve security and customer satisfaction.&#13;
• 𝗛𝗲𝗮𝗹𝘁𝗵𝗰𝗮𝗿𝗲: A hospital can leverage data from IoT devices, edge computing, and the cloud to provide better care for patients, improve workflows for staff, and enable remote diagnosis and treatment.&#13;
• 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝘂𝗳𝗮𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴: Smart factories can use unmanned autonomous vehicles, sensors, and edge computing to automate production processes, increase efficiency and quality, and prevent downtime.&#13;
&#13;
These are just some of the use cases that next-gen digital ecosystems can enable. To realize them, we need to have a holistic approach that considers aspects like low-latency mobile communication, near-source data processing (edge computing) and digital twins.&#13;

2. Optimize operational costs by lowering maintenance work and&#13;
3. Improve maintenance budgets by reducing maintenance costs and by maximizing production time?&#13;
&#13;
Predictive maintenance, also referred to as condition-based maintenance, involves performance monitoring and equipment condition monitoring during regular operations to reduce the chances of a breakdown.&#13;
&#13;
Predictive maintenance’s main goal is to predict equipment failures based on certain parameters and factors. Once predicted, manufacturers take needed steps to prevent this failure with corrective or scheduled maintenance.&#13;

&#13;
Often, C-level managers perceive digital transformation only as implementing another digital tool that will "help" the company to become more "digital" or productive. This is very far from what digital transformation or better we say business transformation is.&#13;
&#13;
Digital transformation is about changing where value is created, and how your business model is structured. More and more, value creation comes from outside the firm not inside, and from external partners rather than internal employees. In the article attached this new production model is an “inverted firm,” a change in organizational structure that affects not only the technology but also the managerial governance that attends it. &#13;
&#13;
Executives must understand and undertake partner relationship management, partner data management, partner product management, platform governance, and platform strategy. They must learn how to motivate people they don’t know to share ideas they don’t have.&#13;

One of the most promising technologies in this space is the Digital Twin. &#13;
&#13;
A Digital Twin is a virtual replica of an object, process, or system that allows retailers to simulate and analyse real-world scenarios, improving efficiency, reducing costs, and driving revenue growth.&#13;
&#13;
📌 According to a study by Accenture, 𝗿𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝘄𝗵𝗼 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗗𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗧𝘄𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝘆 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗲𝗻 𝗮𝗻 𝗮𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝟯𝟬% 𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗶𝗻 𝗲𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆, 𝟮𝟬% 𝗿𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝗻 𝗰𝗼𝘀𝘁𝘀, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝟭𝟱% 𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗶𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘂𝗲.&#13;
&#13;
Using Digital Twin technology in retail can help improve inventory management by providing real-time data on stock levels and sales trends, allowing retailers to optimize inventory and reduce waste. Additionally, Digital Twins can simulate store layouts, helping retailers to optimize store design and layout to improve the customer experience, leading to increased sales and customer loyalty.&#13;
&#13;
Digital Twin technology can also be used in supply chain management, allowing retailers to optimize logistics and reduce costs. By simulating supply chain scenarios, retailers can identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies and take steps to address them. This can help retailers to improve their delivery time and customer satisfaction.&#13;
&#13;
However, it's important to note that the implementation of Digital Twin technology should be part of a broader digital transformation strategy. To ensure success, retailers should involve internal stakeholders, address concerns about job loss, and have a deep understanding of how the changes will affect the customer experience. &#13;
&#13;
It's also important for retailers to consider the risks and challenges associated with digital transformation, such as cyber threats and data privacy concerns, and implement the necessary measures to mitigate them.&#13;
&#13;
Retailers who are looking to stay ahead of the curve and drive growth should consider how they can leverage this technology to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the customer experience.&#13;

&#13;
The digitally enabled factory of today looks very different from the leading factory of ten years ago. Advances in data and analytics, AI, and ML—and the array of technology vendors in the market—mean manufacturers can choose from hundreds of potential solutions and tech applications to improve their ways of working.&#13;
&#13;
Implemented successfully, these solutions deliver irresistible returns. Across a wide range of sectors, it is not uncommon to see 𝟯𝟬 𝘁𝗼 𝟱𝟬 𝗽𝗲𝗿 𝗰𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗿𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗺𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗱𝗼𝘄𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲, 𝟭𝟬 𝘁𝗼 𝟯𝟬 𝗽𝗲𝗿 𝗰𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵𝗽𝘂𝘁, 𝟭𝟱 𝘁𝗼 𝟯𝟬 𝗽𝗲𝗿 𝗰𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗶𝘁𝘆, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝟴𝟱 𝗽𝗲𝗿 𝗰𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗰𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴.&#13;
&#13;
Digital transformations are revolutionizing all aspects of manufacturing, touching not just processes and productivity but also people. The right applications of technology can lead to more empowered decision-making; new opportunities for upskilling, reskilling, and cross-functional collaboration; better talent attraction and retention; and improved workplace safety and employee satisfaction.&#13;
&#13;
Customers see the impacts through reduced manufacturing lead times, right-first-time launch management, and improved customer service and complexity management. And, of course, there are the win–win advantages associated with reduced environmental impact, made possible through lower emissions and reduced waste and more efficient energy, water, and raw-material consumption.&#13;
&#13;
Whether manufacturers are starting out on their digital transformation journeys—or recalibrating their approach after false starts or failed attempts—the approaches adopted by leading companies point to seven golden principles for scaling a successful digital transformation:&#13;
&#13;
1. Communicate well and often&#13;
2. Be specific&#13;
3. Segment, select, and syndicate&#13;
4. Formalize the value at stake&#13;
5. Develop a three- to five-year vision for the network&#13;
6. Design a digital-manufacturing road map&#13;
7. Syndicate the vision and secure leadership buy-in&#13;

Digital twins provide a system-level view of an organization's operations, allowing them to monitor, collect, exchange, analyse, and deliver valuable new insights. &#13;
&#13;
This is leading to smarter, faster decision-making and enabling advantages such as smart manufacturing, supply chain optimization, and product or service innovations. The market for digital twin technology is expected to reach $48.2 billion in 2026, making it an increasingly lucrative avenue for organizations to explore. &#13;
&#13;
In this time of economic recovery, industrial companies have a great opportunity to implement digital twin solutions and minimize their losses. &#13;

While the benefits of digitization and advanced analytics are well documented, the #risk challenges often remain hidden. From the survey by #mckinsey, several key findings emerged:&#13;
&#13;
𝟭. Digital and analytics transformations are widely undertaken now by organizations in all sectors.&#13;
&#13;
𝟮. Risk management has not kept pace with the proliferation of digital and analytics transformations—a gap is opening that can only be closed by risk innovation at scale.&#13;
&#13;
𝟯. The COVID-19 pandemic environment has exacerbated the disparity between risk-management demands and existing capabilities.&#13;
&#13;
𝟰. Most companies are unsure of how to manage digital risks; leading organizations have, however, defined organizational accountabilities and established a range of effective practices and tools.&#13;

&#13;
While 89% of large companies globally have a digital and AI transformation underway, they have only captured 31% of the expected revenue lift and 25% of the expected cost savings from the effort. &#13;
&#13;
Until business leaders are convinced of the value and confident in how to get it, they are unlikely to do the difficult, hands-in-the-dirt changes needed to improve their success rate. To see where digital transformation creates value, McKinsey’s did research which tracked the performance of 80 global banks every year from 2018 to 2022 against a set of 50 normalized metrics, such as digital/mobile adoption, digital sales by banking product, number of people in contact centres, and number of branches. &#13;

&#13;
Optimizing selling, general, and administrative functions, or SG&amp;A, can be a powerful step toward this goal, especially when considered as a key digital strategy lever. With the right end-to-end approach, these functions can transform from a “cost of doing business” into enablers that help the business manage risk, seize new opportunities, and make smarter strategic and operational decisions. &#13;
&#13;
Considering these elements, CPG industry players can expect an EBIT improvement of 2 to 5 percentage points.&#13;

&#13;
There’s no question that fixing the basics is an essential first step. Improving customer experience and journeys stands out as the top reason for a digital transformation, cited by 81% of respondents of Boston Consulting Group (BCG)'s survey. Other top priorities include revenue growth and business model transformation (including the building of new business ventures outside the core), sales and marketing acceleration, and pursuing digital ecosystems and partnerships. &#13;
&#13;
Respondents also highlighted many functional areas as priorities, including support functions, compliance, supply chain, pricing, procurement, manufacturing, and operations.&#13;
&#13;
Overall, the priorities can be grouped into four broad strategic objectives, based on the share of executives’ citations of each:&#13;
• Improving customer experience and go-to-market (cited by 31% of respondents)&#13;
• Innovation and growth in the core and beyond (28%)&#13;
• Performance improvement through the operational value chain (23%)&#13;
• Performance improvement in support functions (18%) &#13;

⚡Around 2.5 Quintillion bytes of data are created every day, most of which are created by consumers (online research, past purchases, mobile payments), whom all contribute to the development of consumer-centric strategies.&#13;
&#13;
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the ever-expanding network of interconnected internet-enabled devices that use data (stored in a large cloud) as their main currency. 50Bn devices connected by 2020 entail new business models for companies, new ways of processing and manufacturing and new ways of marketing and buying. &#13;

&#13;
&#13;
With limited resources at hand, companies need to stay smart and efficient when it comes to investing in innovation.&#13;
&#13;
This is a challenging time for many companies. On the one hand, supply chain disruption, labour shortage, raw material and energy price hikes are driving up business costs. On the other, demand is slack due to consumers’ reduced purchasing power and an uncertain global economic outlook. Together these conditions squeeze companies’ profits and cast a shadow on their #growth prospects. In this time of difficulty, executives around the world find it more urgent than ever to sharpen their organisations’ innovation #strategy to create new markets for growth.&#13;
&#13;
Economics has long taught us that R&amp;D and technology advances, as measured by R&amp;D spending and a number of patents, are the central drivers of innovation and growth. But market creation for growth is not inevitably about technological innovation.&#13;
&#13;
With limited resources at hand, companies need to stay smart and efficient when it comes to investing in innovation. If technologies are involved, they should enable and facilitate the delivery of key buyer value elements, instead of making products or services too futuristic, esoteric or complicated for customers to adopt.&#13;

Leaders have many options and opportunities when it comes to smart factory transformations, both in terms of which technologies to use and how to deploy them.&#13;
&#13;
Throughout the research, several common themes emerged, including the need for strong change management and cultural considerations. Transformation is only as successful as the people who embrace it. Additionally, there are specific considerations unique to the smart factory and its technologies that leaders should address to ensure success.&#13;

📌 Organizational culture plays a crucial role in determining the success of a business. Despite being an abstract concept, there is empirical evidence that highlights its impact on company growth. Engaged workforces are less likely to leave, work more efficiently, and provide better customer service, leading to increased profitability.&#13;
&#13;
Creating an exceptional corporate culture is a goal that companies worldwide invest enormous amounts of resources in. However, decision-makers often underestimate the complexity of organizational culture. Similar to societal culture, it is shaped by unspoken assumptions, conventional behaviors, traditions, and implicit rules that dictate how business is conducted.&#13;
&#13;
Organizational culture can be compared to an iceberg, with only surface indicators visible above the waterline. The real bulk of the iceberg, however, lies beneath the surface, composed of deeply embedded cultural norms that prove challenging to change.&#13;
&#13;
This is an essential perspective for leaders looking to transform their organizations genuinely. Ignoring the submerged aspects of the cultural iceberg can lead to the failure of even the most well-intentioned change initiatives.&#13;

This requires a well-planned and strategic approach rather than just sporadic technology integrations. Based on extensive industry research by McKinsey, the following are the key strategies that every E&amp;C professional should consider.&#13;
&#13;
1️⃣ Operational Excellence: Address genuine operational pain points instead of merely deploying new IT solutions.&#13;
2️⃣ Use Case Evolution: Adopt a continuous cycle of creating and updating use cases that cater to authentic business needs.&#13;
3️⃣ Promoting Collaboration: Develop digital use cases that foster collaboration across multiple teams and trades, ensuring smooth information transition.&#13;
4️⃣ Skill Transformation: It's crucial to reskill and restructure engineering teams, preparing them for the demands and opportunities of the digital age.&#13;
5️⃣ Value Realization: Adjust project baselines to ensure that the value derived from digital integrations is effectively captured.&#13;
6️⃣ Enterprise Impact: Look beyond individual projects; focus on unlocking broader impacts by standardizing digital tools and data-sharing practices across business units.&#13;
&#13;
The competitive edge in the E&amp;C industry will increasingly belong to those who not only adapt but lead in integrating these digital practices. Being proactive in this transformation can create unparalleled advantages in the marketplace.&#13;

This popularity might be due to the growing 𝗱𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 of enterprises, which has led them to embrace cloud-based platforms and services. Low-code/no-code platforms make it possible for enterprises to design and integrate custom apps without hiring extra developers.&#13;
&#13;
Because of the capacity to interface with new tools and technologies, the low-code market has evolved. The standard capabilities have not altered, but they have expanded into areas like user experiences, data management, and process automation.&#13;
&#13;
Low code is beneficial for businesses of all sizes. However, businesses must embrace digital transformation and be willing to adapt their operations to implement low-code approaches.&#13;
&#13;
The needs of businesses and developers are comparable in the market's enterprise and startup/small business segments. In fact, developer tools are evolving in the same way that business users' tools are. Low-code/no-code platforms are rapidly maturing and expanding to integrate with other artificial intelligence technologies.&#13;

Operationally intensive companies are entering a new era of automation and digitization, which will dramatically impact the skills they need to stay ahead. With technology replacing many tasks once performed by humans, nearly every job will change and employees will need to upskill. However, most organizations are not prepared for the future of work.&#13;
&#13;
The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this transformation, forcing companies to adapt to a new normal of physical distancing, and changing customer behaviours and preferences. To stay competitive, organizations must rethink their operations and embrace digital solutions. Manufacturing companies are streamlining supply chains and production lines, while service companies are prioritizing digital customer journeys and contactless operations. These changes will require a major shift in workforce skills and capabilities, from an increase in remote work to a need for new tech proficiency and health and safety awareness.&#13;
&#13;
Analysis done by McKinsey &amp; Company suggests that 𝟯𝟵 𝘁𝗼 𝟱𝟴 𝗽𝗲𝗿 𝗰𝗲𝗻𝘁 of the worldwide work activities in operationally intensive sectors could be automated using currently demonstrated technologies. That is 𝟭.𝟯 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲𝘀 the automation potential of activities in other sectors&#13;

In the near future, AI-based systems will be able to continuously monitor equipment, identify potential problems and recommend or take corrective actions to prevent failures. This will enable organizations to move from a traditional, reactive approach to maintenance (known as corrective maintenance) to a predictive or even preventive approach. The benefits of AI-based predictive maintenance are significant.&#13;

&#13;
🎯Manage it like a product!&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Today’s predominant, and largely unsuccessful, approaches to data that organizations typically employ are either a grassroots or big-bang data strategy—neither of which enables them to make the most of their data investments.&#13;
&#13;
1. Grassroots approach&#13;
In a grassroots approach, individual teams must piece together the data and technologies they need. This approach results in significant duplication of efforts and a tangle of bespoke technology architectures that are costly to build, manage, and maintain.&#13;
&#13;
2. Big-bang strategy&#13;
At organizations employing the big-bang strategy, a centralized team extracts, cleanses, and aggregates data en masse. This approach can eliminate some of the rework that occurs, but it’s often not aligned with business use cases and therefore fails to support end users’ specific needs. End users often struggle to confirm that the data provide the necessary level of governance and quality, which limits the time savings. Later work on new use cases that are aligned with business value often triggers a grassroots approach and its associated problems.&#13;
&#13;
These strategies fail to lay the foundation for current and future use cases that will create value.&#13;
&#13;
🎯A better approach is managing data like a product. McKinsey Digital finds that when companies instead manage data like a consumer product—be it digital or physical—they can realize near-term value from their data investments and pave the way for quickly getting more value tomorrow.&#13;
&#13;
How to get into this approach, here are some insights:&#13;

The past few years have seen unprecedented disruptions, and the turmoil shows little sign of letting up any time soon. Challenges abound, and companies find it nearly impossible to plan for the future. Such a volatile environment requires a new approach to devising a strategy.&#13;
&#13;
Uncertainty means risk, but it can also spell opportunity. Handled correctly, it allows organisations to expand beyond the boundaries of their current business, potentially in unexpected directions.&#13;

These solutions have helped them bring in more transparency in their internal systems and savings in their operational costs. However, the next wave of evolution for Industry 4.0 will be to develop solutions that push the boundaries further and help organisations achieve overall optima for their entire value chain. &#13;
&#13;
Driving this new wave of improvements will require a great deal of collaboration between multiple ecosystem partners to come together and develop new integrated solutions. For example, as companies are thinking of reducing the time to market, technologies such as BDA would allow the integration of disparate algorithms, enabling optimisation across the entire value chain, backed by data. The integrated data would help simulate the impact on key parameters using Digital Twins, empowering organisations to take well-informed decisions at the organisation level. &#13;
&#13;
Organisations will have to look beyond the existing internal alliances for Industry 4.0 needs, which includes collaborating with external partners. The outward look would give rise to newer business models with Industry 4.0 at its centre. For this to happen, there is a need for a stronger digital ecosystem with partnerships at business levels. For example, partnerships between big-data analytics (BDA) service providers, Digital Twin solution providers, and connected solutions. Building one architecture to accommodate these aspects would lead to newer business models, and further, manufacturers enriching the data from their own domains.&#13;
&#13;
It is time for the Industry 4.0 ecosystem to collaborate at the business level and meet the growing needs of manufacturers. For this to happen, organisations need to fund newer business models that enable the digital ecosystem.&#13;

&#13;
The increasingly unavoidable facts about global warming, population growth, global food crisis and scarcity of resources lead the project team to consider how a holistic development could offset the dangerous consequences of human inhabitation. One of the largest drivers of environmental destruction and the loss of biodiversity remains the agricultural industry, and so the project team has used a sustainable agricultural model to drive forth the input based system of design.&#13;
&#13;
The concept combines a variety of innovative technologies, such as energy positive homes, renewable energy, energy storage, door-step high-yield organic food production, vertical farming aquaponics/aeroponics, water management and waste-to-resource systems.&#13;

❗The consistent and seamless digitalisation of all the processes forms the basis for automation production. Naturally, this also requires appropriate technologies, production processes and operational and organisational structures.&#13;
&#13;
In addition to cross-company networking and integration across value-added networks, universal standards are also necessary for the technical description and implementation of Industry 4.0. In the "factory of the future", the boundaries between business management software and production management IT will become increasingly blurred. This will allow a decentralised organisation that has the option of implementing flexible and favourable adjustments and expansions.&#13;
&#13;
The focus of the first big data applications concentrated on external consumer data from the internet and social media. Their evaluation held the promise of knowledge and competitive advantages for companies. In-house data remained unused. Since, then, many industrial companies have made massive investments in their IT systems, with result that optimised calculation processes are also possible in real-time. The necessary software already exists. Time and cost savings as well as lower business risk strongly suggest introducing such software. The intention is to derive knowledge for obtaining business advantage from the data that is won. ⚡𝗔 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮-𝗱𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗻 𝗼𝗿𝗴𝗮𝗻𝗶𝘀𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗮𝗹𝘀𝗼 𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘁 𝗶𝘁𝘀 𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗸𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗺𝗮𝗿𝗸𝗲𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴, 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗹𝘆 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘀𝗲𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗰𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗿. ⚡&#13;

It's incredible to consider the evidence that suggests we are in the midst of another "mass flourishing". It wasn't just the invention of one technology, but the combination of all of these new advancements across the three foundational spheres of technology: information, machines, and materials that led to the tremendous economic acceleration of the 20th century. &#13;
&#13;
It's inspiring to see how far we have come, and I look forward to seeing the potential breakthroughs this next era brings! &#13;

&#13;
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly permeated various industries, offering solutions that were previously unthinkable. Predictive Analysis, in particular, is changing the way the construction industry operates. This technology doesn’t just analyse data, it learns, adapts, and predicts. &#13;
&#13;
Assessing patterns from large amounts of historical data, it offers insights into potential equipment maintenance needs, labour shortages, or project delays caused by weather. This allows businesses to proactively strategize and navigate potential pitfalls instead of reacting to challenges.&#13;

In an industry where margins can be thin and reputations are built over decades, the ability to consistently deliver projects on time and within budget can be a game-changer. Moreover, the competitive edge gained by adopting such advanced technologies can position firms at the forefront of the industry, making them the preferred choice for clients.&#13;
&#13;
To stay ahead of the curve in today’s rapidly evolving business landscape, businesses should embrace the transformative power of AI and let Predictive Analysis guide their foresight in construction. &#13;

Organizations that discover innovative methods to serve their consumers, frequently enabled by the deployment of emerging or disruptive technologies, will succeed. AI, cloud-based technology, and blockchain are some of these technologies.&#13;
&#13;
Digital transformation efforts, on the other hand, must instil confidence in digital products and services through alignment with digital trust. When trust is established in digital products and services, customer satisfaction and involvement rise, leading to greater business outcomes and growth for an organisation.&#13;
&#13;
As a result, a digital trust mindset should underpin how organizations approach digital transformation. Leaders may play a significant role in aiding the digital trust journey within their businesses by determining if any transformation activities that are now ongoing or are about to begin have adequately integrated trust considerations from the start. Leaders can look out for their various stakeholders and ensure that trust is going alongside the bottom line.&#13;

&#13;
Achieving this kind of impact would require certain conditions to be in place, notably overcoming the technical, organizational, and regulatory hurdles. In particular, companies that use IoT technology will play a critical role in developing the right systems and processes to maximize their value. McKinsey's survey finds that:&#13;
&#13;
• 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗯𝗲𝘁𝘄𝗲𝗲𝗻 𝗜𝗼𝗧 𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺𝘀 𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹. Of the total potential economic value the IoT enables, interoperability is required for 40 per cent on average and for nearly 60 per cent in some settings.&#13;
  &#13;
• 𝗖𝘂𝗿𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗹𝘆, 𝗺𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗜𝗼𝗧 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱. For example, on an oil rig that has 30,000 sensors, only 1 per cent of the data are examined. That’s because this information is used mostly to detect and control anomalies—not for optimization and prediction, which provide the greatest value.&#13;
  &#13;
• 𝗕𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀-𝘁𝗼-𝗯𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝘄𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗯𝗹𝘆 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗲—nearly 70 per cent of it—than consumer uses.&#13;
  &#13;
• 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗜𝗼𝗧 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗮 𝗹𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲 𝗽𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻 𝗱𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗼𝗺𝗶𝗲𝘀. Still, it is estimated that it will have a higher overall value impact in advanced economies because of the higher value per use. However, developing economies could generate nearly 40 per cent of the IoT’s value, and nearly half in some settings.&#13;
  &#13;
• 𝗖𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝘄𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗺𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗯𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗳𝗶𝘁𝘀. It is estimated that IoT users (businesses, other organizations, and consumers) could capture 90 per cent of IoT applications' value. &#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Technologies that challenge the status quo are those that enable digital transformation. Digital transformation is a process of using technology to create new or improved business processes, products, or services. This can be done in order to reduce costs, improve efficiency, or create new revenue streams.&#13;
&#13;
Digital transformation can be enabled by a number of different technologies, including cloud computing, artificial intelligence, big data, and the Internet of Things. These technologies can challenge the status quo by making it possible to do things that were previously not possible, or by making existing processes more efficient.&#13;
&#13;
The benefits of digital transformation can be significant. For example, Accenture estimates that digital transformation can help companies achieve a 30 percent reduction in costs. McKinsey has found that companies that have embraced digital transformation are 26 percent more profitable than their peers.&#13;
&#13;
However, digital transformation can also be disruptive. It can challenge existing business models and lead to the need for new skills and processes. As such, it is important for companies to carefully consider how they can best take advantage of digital transformation while minimizing its risks.&#13;
&#13;
Innovation and constant breakthroughs in the worlds of business and IT mean that the status quo of running a business is constantly shifting. BPM (Business Process Management) itself has shifted from a one-time initiative to a constant process.&#13;

&#13;
One of the advantages of Web2 was the ability to share digital assets at a low cost. But the information was easy to share because it was easy to copy. As a result, enterprise marketers didn’t invest much attention or money in creating high-value digital assets.&#13;
&#13;
Web3 changes this by making it possible to assign to a digital asset a non-fungible token, which is a digital identifier that can’t be copied or changed. The NFT is then recorded in a blockchain, or a digital ledger in which records (called blocks) are linked using cryptography.&#13;

&#13;
In the article, Bernard Marr states that "Naysayers claim artificial intelligence could lead to a decline in human creativity and innovation, but really it offers a wealth of new ways to improve imagination and creative thinking". (https://lnkd.in/dEtURiMq)&#13;
&#13;
I agree with this yet I believe this is fully true only if AI is used in the 𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝘄𝗮𝘆 to open new creative approaches to the same challenges. We are still in the early adoption phase of AI and we are just exploring things, using it extensively, relying too much on it - finding the right way. &#13;
&#13;
How do you perceive the AI in your daily routine?&#13;

&#13;
That's right, instead of buying a machine outright, you can now pay a monthly fee to use one. The term “machine as a service” (MaaS) is used to describe the outsourcing of the management and maintenance of machinery to a specialist service provider. The service provider is responsible for ensuring that the machinery is kept in good working order and is available to the customer on an as-needed basis. &#13;
&#13;
MaaS arrangements are becoming increasingly popular as businesses seek to reduce their costs and free up their own staff to focus on their core activities. There are a number of advantages to using a MaaS provider, including access to expertise and specialist equipment, lower costs, and increased flexibility. First, it can be cheaper than buying a machine outright, since you're only paying for the use of the machine, not the entire purchase price. Second, it can be more convenient, since the company takes care of maintenance and repairs. &#13;
&#13;
MaaS providers typically offer a range of services, from simple repair and maintenance services to more comprehensive support packages that include regular servicing, 24/7 support, and emergency call-out services. When choosing a MaaS provider, it is important to consider their experience, reputation, and the range of services they offer. You should also make sure that you are clear about the terms of the agreement, including any charges for call-outs or other services.&#13;
&#13;
 So if you're in the market for a new machine, but don't want the hassle of owning one, consider a machine as a service. It just might be the perfect solution for you.&#13;

Getting it right will mean gaining a sustainable advantage. But the impact of these new work models on organisations’ risk profiles has been discussed much less than the benefits. Business leaders should factor this new risk profile into how organisations change to unlock the full potential of the opportunity of new work models.&#13;
&#13;
Many of the benefits of reimagining how, when and where work gets done have been discussed extensively: lower real estate costs for companies, as well as less need for travel, and greater schedule and location flexibility, for individuals. Much less debate has occurred about how new work models will also reshape an organisation’s risk profile, however. Most notably, it will require business and functional leaders to monitor new intertwined vulnerabilities, assess risk tolerance and ensure the company and employees are adequately protected from unforeseen and interconnected consequences.&#13;

&#13;
Based on its experience with industrial clients, MIT Sloan School of Management has developed a strategy to avoid falling into the trap of purchasing technology that is underutilised or fails to deliver the desired business outcomes. It is recommended for a more gradual transition process that incorporates systems thinking and addresses cultural norms.&#13;
&#13;
This will translate lofty Industry 4.0 visions into actionable strategies and next steps to improve internal processes. The following are important steps:&#13;
&#13;
The initial stages of transformation will be driven by 𝗳𝗼𝗰𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝗻 𝗰𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺𝘀. Manufacturers frequently install networks of hundreds of sensors and then return to solve a specific problem. Problems are not solved by technology. In fact, technology has the potential to exacerbate problems by increasing data overload and eroding employees' trust in the new system.&#13;
&#13;
Instead of launching a full-scale network with hundreds of sensors, a more cautious approach that focuses on a specific problem and uses Industry 4.0 capabilities to solve it is recommended. Engaging employees to identify critical stress points in their jobs, as well as evaluating processes to identify opportunities for improvement and value creation, is critical for larger transformation.&#13;
&#13;
Begin by "𝘀𝗲𝗲𝗶𝗻𝗴" 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗳𝗲𝗲𝗱𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗹𝗼𝗼𝗽𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗺𝗶𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴. Knowing where to establish a feedback loop is critical to the business value of Industry 4.0, but the question is where to begin. The hunt for hidden factories can be fruitful because it allows you to listen to the system and identify the most significant gaps. It is also critical to implement processes that reduce the time between measurement and action. Data collected in a database or spreadsheet is insufficient to drive change.&#13;
&#13;
𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗱𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘄𝗵𝗶𝗹𝗲 𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝘂𝗻𝘀𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺𝘀. The implementation of new technologies such as sensors, cloud platforms, and advanced algorithms can provide workers with new insights. However, as soon as they encounter problems or complex and unwieldy systems, they will revert to old systems and traditional ways of working.&#13;
&#13;
Workers can more easily digest new systems and adjust to new work patterns if Industry 4.0 initiatives are tightly scoped and incremental. Simultaneously, old systems must be removed to eliminate fallback options.&#13;

1. New processes. Sell the same stuff at higher margins: Cut production and delivery costs, automate for efficiencies, cut fat in the supply chain or manufacturing, and utilize robots.&#13;
&#13;
2. New experiences. Sell more of the same stuff to the same people: Increase retention and share by powerfully connecting with customers.&#13;
&#13;
3. New features. Sell enhanced stuff to the same people: Add improvements that drive incremental purchases. &#13;
&#13;
4. New customers. Sell more of the same stuff to new people: Introduce the product to new markets with needs similar to your core, or to markets where it might address a different need. &#13;
&#13;
5. New offerings. Make new stuff to sell: Develop a new product — not just enhancements. Find new needs to solve within existing markets, or invest in a new category. &#13;
&#13;
6. New models. Sell stuff in a new way: Reimagine how to go to market by creating new revenue streams, channels, and ways of creating value. This can be as simple as moving to a subscription model..&#13;

But there are also many other scenarios where digital twins are used as a way to measure and improve the performance of an existing product.&#13;
&#13;
A digital twin is a virtual representation that serves as the real-time digital counterpart of a physical object or process. The virtual twin is disrupting the entire product lifecycle management (PLM), from design to manufacturing to service and operations. The logic behind this is that any time there is a link between physical objects and processes, the potential for performance improvement exists.&#13;
&#13;
 When you design a product, what do you do? You create a physical dummy. It’s the product’s representation in digital form. You don’t need to physically create the digital copy of your product, but the digital copy is just as important for performance as a physical copy is for consumption.&#13;
&#13;
Don’t think of your product as an object. Think of it as a process. It needs to be designed and manufactured in order to be produced and traded in real time.&#13;

The digital ecosystem comprises organisations, suppliers, customers, and business alliances, who are either providing or receiving product (machine parts/software) and services (cloud computing, AI/ML capabilities). Each ecosystem partner has a distinctive role to play, and when done right, can together unlock more value than any individual stakeholder.&#13;
&#13;
Industry 4.0 moves away from mass production to mass customisation. When applied as point solutions, each &#13;
ecosystem stakeholder can focus and become efficient in specialised competencies. However, to deliver complex solutions and mass customisation, it is important for ecosystem partners to work together within the same umbrella. The movement towards an Industry 4.0 world is enhanced by a high degree of digital connectivity across the value chain. &#13;
&#13;
For a connected operation to have the desired agility, each part of the value chain (from planning to manufacturing to customer service) should be connected to the digital ecosystem. This helps build synergies amongst business functions, leading to faster implementation of actions.&#13;

As a result, they often make only ad hoc changes and investments in the digital arena, with ineffectual results. The challenge, to which most companies have yet to rise, is figuring out how to fully capture the different kinds of value that these technologies offer. Developing a strategy for digital transformation that fully leverages this value is also not easy. Without a comprehensive assessment of what digital technologies can offer, firms tend to assume that any application of modern digital technologies will lead to a digital transformation.&#13;
&#13;
Defined by Harvard Business Review there are four distinct tiers of digital transformation, each of which meets different strategic objectives and allows companies to maximize the value they capture from digital technologies:&#13;
&#13;
1. Tier One: Operational efficiencies&#13;
2. Tier Two: Advanced operational efficiencies&#13;
3. Tier Three: Data-driven services from value chains&#13;
4. Tier Four: Data-driven services from digital platforms&#13;
&#13;
To think properly about these four tiers of transformation, the first step is to recognize that modern digital technologies have two notable value drivers: data in its new expansive role, and emergent digital ecosystems.&#13;
&#13;
Data used to be episodic (generated by discrete events such as the shipment of a component from a supplier), but increasingly it is becoming interactive (generated continuously by sensors and the IoT to track information).  Two main kinds of digital ecosystems have emerged, neither of which existed before modern advances in data and digital connectivity. One kind is the production ecosystem, which encompasses digital linkages within value chains. By linking sensor and IoT data from cars to spare-part suppliers, warehouses, and service dealers, for example, car companies can offer predictive maintenance services. The other kind is the consumption ecosystem, which involves networks outside of a firm’s value chain. &#13;

To understand which approach you’ll need to take, ask yourself two questions: &#13;
&#13;
𝟭) Is your transformation driven by internal needs or external forces? &#13;
𝟮) Does it need to happen quickly, or do you have more time to transform?&#13;
&#13;
Business transformations vary in terms of content, pace, and place of initiation — and it’s rare that companies are only undergoing one at a time. Doing business today means navigating a complex landscape of interconnected and interdependent issues, each having multiple stakeholders and agendas. Hence, organizations need to understand the various types of transformations, and know how to manage each.&#13;

&#13;
Companies across the globe see and act upon the need for compressed transformation to remain relevant while becoming more resilient and responsible. This includes the transformation of a core piece of their business – manufacturing. Three burning platforms are driving them toward the next digital frontier:&#13;
&#13;
1️⃣ The still ongoing pandemic has accelerated the change.&#13;
2️⃣ Software redefines physical products.&#13;
3️⃣ The sustainability imperative depends on digital.&#13;
&#13;
All three developments are landmarks of the 𝗻𝗲𝘅𝘁 𝗱𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗲𝗿 ahead for most manufacturers. They pose significant challenges to how customer and employee-relevant manufacturers will remain, how resilient they will be and how responsibly they can act.&#13;
&#13;
🎯The technologies are available and have proven their worth and both the need and the benefits of digital manufacturing are obvious. Companies that connect technology intelligently and manage the change it brings wisely can go well beyond the efficiency and effectiveness scenarios that Industry 4.0 provides.&#13;

&#13;
AI is one of the main forces that will transform industries in the next decades. Many companies have invested in AI to unlock its potential. However, only 11% have released significant value—as the majority have failed to scale beyond pilots, reimagine the way they work with data, and redefine human-AI interaction. &#13;
&#13;
AI - current state and trends:&#13;
1. Strong potential of AI has driven high growth, underpinned by focused investments in optimization, predictive maintenance, personalization, and automation&#13;
&#13;
2. Yet, only 11% of firms report significant financial value from AI. Those that do, deliberately reimagine the way &#13;
they work with data and successfully move from pilots and proof of concept to scaling&#13;
&#13;
3. A critical element is people, with high value unlocked in effective organizational learning and change management&#13;
&#13;
4. Apart from driving financial outcomes, AI can also reignite team effectiveness, morale, &amp; culture in the long term&#13;
&#13;
5. Despite positive outlook and growth, there are several dynamics to manage: labour market shifts and talent &#13;
shortages, data capability gaps, ethicality and transparency concerns, and expected increase in regulations&#13;

The next target is their own data.&#13;
&#13;
Applying advanced analytics to manufacturers’ data can produce insights to optimize the productivity of individual assets as well as the total manufacturing operation. Deployed in conjunction with each other, these tools enable operators to maximize their productivity and profitability.&#13;
&#13;
Predictive maintenance analyses the historical performance data of machines to forecast when one is likely to fail, limit the time it is out of service, and identify the root cause of the problem. Yield-energy-throughput (YET) analytics can be used to ensure that those individual machines are as efficient as possible when they are operating, helping to increase their yields and throughput and reduce the amount of energy they consume. Profit-per-hour (PPH) maximization analytics, meanwhile, scrutinizes the thousands of parameters and conditions that have an impact on the total profitability of an integrated supply chain (from raw materials purchasing to final sales), providing intelligence on how best to capitalize on given conditions.&#13;
&#13;
Together, these advanced analytics approaches can deliver EBITDA margin improvements of as much as 4 to 10 percent.]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jul 2022 07:00:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Post 97</title><link>https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:share:7114608117887217664</link><description>&lt;![CDATA[A good digital ID is an identification that is verified and authenticated to a high degree of assurance over digital channels, is unique, established with individual consent, protects user privacy and ensures control over personal data. &#13;

&#13;
Boards are willing to accept greater risk in expanding product lines, transforming ways of working and entering new markets.

&#13;
&#13;
With so much at stake to build digital capabilities that drive customer centricity and productivity, why do so many companies fail? And not just troubled companies—top performers, market leaders, and investor favourites, too. A research by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) shows that 70% of digital transformations fall short of their objectives, often with profound consequences.&#13;
&#13;
📈Digital leaders achieve earnings growth that is 1.8 times higher than digital laggards—and more than double the growth in total enterprise value. In the short term, digital technologies and ways of working offer productivity improvements and better customer experiences. In the medium term, digital opens up new growth opportunities and business model innovation. Successful transformations also set companies up for sustained success; they won’t have to digitally transform again as they master continuous innovation. Investors say that 50% of companies should invest more aggressively in digital capabilities and technology.&#13;
&#13;
But there is a conundrum for management: digital transformations are difficult to execute. And with so much on the line, only 30% of transformations succeed in achieving their objectives. There are good reasons for this, too. The technology is important, but the people dimension (organization, operating model, processes, and culture) is usually the determining factor. Organizational inertia from deeply rooted behaviours is a big impediment.&#13;
&#13;
Failure should not be an option, and yet it is the most common result. The consequences in terms of investments of money, organizational effort, and elapsed time are massive. Digital laggards fall behind in customer engagement, process efficiency, and innovation.&#13;
&#13;
When trying to bring everyone along with the overall plan, it can be easy to compromise and lose focus on the transformational aspiration. This is where the trouble usually starts. But among all the decisions that must be made, six critical success factors stand out. The companies that get these six factors right flip their odds of success from 30% to 80%.&#13;
&#13;
🎯The six essential success factors are:&#13;
&#13;
1. An Integrated Strategy with Clear Transformation Goals. &#13;
2. Leadership Commitment from CEO Through Middle Management. &#13;
3. Deploying High-Calibre Talent.&#13;
4. An Agile Governance Mindset That Drives Broader Adoption. &#13;
5. Effective Monitoring of Progress Toward Defined Outcomes. &#13;
6. Business-Led Modular Technology and Data Platform.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Often, C-level and managers perceive digital transformation only as implementing another digital tool that will "help" company to become more "digital" or productive. This is very far from what digital transformation or better we say business transformation is.&#13;
&#13;
Digital transformation is about changing where value is created, and how your business model is structured. More and more, value creation comes from outside the firm not inside, and from external partners rather than internal employees. In the article attached this new production model an “inverted firm,” a change in organizational structure that affects not only the technology but also the managerial governance that attends it. &#13;
&#13;
Executives must understand and undertake partner relationship management, partner data management, partner product management, platform governance, and platform strategy. They must learn how to motivate people they don’t know to share ideas they don’t have.&#13;

For machine operators and factory managers, preventative maintenance and asset repairs consume unnecessary resources, eat into operational costs and cripple efficient operations. In such cases, Predictive Maintenance could be helpful.&#13;

Surprised?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
How are corporations dealing with helping their employees adapt to -- and even embrace -- new digital tools?&#13;
&#13;
Well, the survey of 1,475 senior business leaders at companies with more than 500 employees all over the world -- offers quite a few clues.&#13;
&#13;
One of the best numbers --&gt; 70% could not identify exactly who is responsible for managing the adoption of new technologies in their organization.&#13;
&#13;
A recent Gartner survey offered that 55% of companies regret the IT purchases they make. A clue may be indicated by the fact that a fulsome 67% of the people who bought this technology weren't even IT people.&#13;
&#13;
It's irresponsible to just jumping on buying and implementing technology instead first understanding your current digital maturity, create a plan, team and culture towards digital transformation and then start implementations, closely monitor technology adoptions and overall ROI.&#13;

Digital transformation is changing the way we live, work, and communicate at a rapid pace. To succeed in this new environment, we need to be innovative. But what does innovation mean? And how can we foster a culture of innovation in our organizations?&#13;
&#13;
Innovation is not just about inventing something new. It’s also about using what we have in a better way. It’s about being creative, curious, open-minded, and willing to try new things.&#13;
&#13;
A culture of innovation is a group of people who share these values and behaviours. They are empowered by their leaders to take ownership of their work, collaborate with others, and continuously improve. They are also supported by the resources they need, such as technology, talent, and data. And most importantly, they trust each other and their customers.&#13;
&#13;
A culture of innovation can help us unleash the full potential of our team and deliver value to our customers. It can also help us adapt and evolve in the fast-changing digital landscape.&#13;
&#13;
But how can we create a culture of innovation in our organizations? Check it out in an article: https://lnkd.in/d4FbDN9V&#13;

Walking along the corridors and stairs of the Colosseum, I wondered what it looked like when it was fully built, full of cheering crowds and gladiator fights. &#13;
&#13;
As tourists, we got an audio-video guide on an iPod. Specific locations were numbered so you can play the audio and video related to that place.&#13;
&#13;
This helped a little to imagine the place, the magnificent history made there, yet it was still missing something more. &#13;
&#13;
It came to my mind that with technology this experience can be immersive and even better. With a great #AR app, which everyone can have on their phone, tourists can really have a great visual of the place, with real-time rendering, location identification, information shows etc.&#13;
&#13;
There is definitely a lot of space to digitalize the tourism industry.&#13;

This entails having the ability to access, comprehend, and communicate effectively with data. &#13;
&#13;
It's crucial for organizations to make their internal data more accessible throughout the company to take advantage of insights and opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
However, data literacy isn't only about having the right tools and technologies. It also necessitates the 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿 𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗱𝘀𝗲𝘁 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗰𝘂𝗹𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗯𝘆 𝗲𝗺𝗽𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗲𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗼𝘆𝗲𝗲𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗹𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘀𝘂𝗮𝘀𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗹𝘆 𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮. The emphasis should be on using technology responsibly and collaboratively rather than chasing the latest trends.&#13;
&#13;
Despite the fact that AI is a potent technology that can revolutionize businesses, it's not a magic solution. It still requires human input and oversight. That's where data literacy comes in - unlocking the potential of AI and other technologies. &#13;
&#13;
📌Companies that invest in data literacy will have a competitive edge in the future.&#13;

In a recent article by the World Economic Forum (WEF), three megatrends have been emphasized to be driving the factories of the future: &#13;
&#13;
1. 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗶𝘁𝘆: digital technologies such as cloud computing, the internet of things (IoT), 5G and blockchain are enabling unprecedented levels of data collection, sharing and analysis across the entire value chain. This allows manufacturers to optimize their operations, enhance their customer experience and create new business models. For example, one of the WEF's lighthouse factories in China uses IoT sensors to monitor its equipment performance and maintenance needs in real-time, 𝗿𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗱𝗼𝘄𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝗯𝘆 𝟱𝟬% 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗯𝘆 𝟮𝟱%.&#13;
   &#13;
2. 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲: artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), analytics and augmented reality (AR) are empowering manufacturers to leverage data for better decision-making, problem-solving and innovation. These technologies can help manufacturers improve their quality, efficiency, safety and sustainability. WEF's other lighthouse factory in Germany uses AI to analyze data from its production lines and identify defects before they become costly issues.&#13;
   &#13;
3. 𝗙𝗹𝗲𝘅𝗶𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: smart robotics, additive manufacturing (AM), cobots and digital twins are enabling manufacturers to automate their processes with more flexibility and agility. These technologies can help manufacturers adapt to changing customer demands, market conditions and environmental factors. A lighthouse factory in Sweden uses AM to produce customized parts on demand, 𝗿𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝗻𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆 𝗰𝗼𝘀𝘁𝘀 𝗯𝘆 𝟱𝟬% 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗱 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲𝘀 𝗯𝘆 𝟵𝟬%.&#13;
&#13;
These three megatrends are not only transforming individual factories but also creating a network of connected factories that can collaborate and learn from each other. This will require a new mindset and skillset for both managers and workers who need to embrace digital innovation as a strategic priority.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
It’s easy to see why more and more manufacturing companies are talking about what’s often called the circular economy—in which businesses create supply chains that recover or recycle the resources used to create their products. Shrinking their environmental footprint, trimming operational waste, and using expensive resources more efficiently are certainly appealing to CEOs.&#13;
&#13;
But creating a circular business model is challenging, and taking the wrong approach can be expensive. Creating a sustainable circular business model depends on many factors, but perhaps the most important is choosing a pathway that aligns with a company’s capabilities and resources—and one that addresses the constraints on its operations.&#13;
&#13;
🎯Manufacturing companies—from the producers of products that serve the new economy to the more traditional companies that provide our clothing and furnishings—can create a circular business model in many ways. Most involve a combination of three basic strategies:&#13;
&#13;
1️⃣Retain product ownership (RPO) - the producer rents or leases its product to the customer rather than selling it. Thus the producer is responsible for products when consumers have finished with them.&#13;
&#13;
2️⃣Product life extension (PLE). Companies applying this strategy focus on designing products to last longer, which may open up possibilities for markets in used products. Because a longer product lifespan means fewer purchases over time, this may seem like a bad idea for original-equipment manufacturers.&#13;
&#13;
3️⃣Design for recycling (DFR). Companies applying this strategy redesign their products and manufacturing processes to maximize recoverability of the materials involved for use in new products. This strategy often involves partnering with companies that have specific technological expertise or that may be best able to use the materials recovered.  &#13;
&#13;
Harvard Business Review's article on Circular Business Model is a great start to explore these points: http://ow.ly/32A550IGJzm&#13;

&#13;
Pick up any industry or professional publication and you’ll be deluged with articles extolling the value of digital transformation. Supporters tout new capabilities as do-or-die. “All companies must become tech companies” is a common refrain. “Organizations that speed their decision intelligence capabilities will survive, and those that don’t will fail” is another.&#13;
&#13;
There is an enormous potential for new digital capabilities to improve business performance, create more satisfying jobs, and solve some long-standing issues that have proven beyond the reach of methods typically employed today.&#13;
&#13;
Still, adaptation and change remain challenges for most companies. All change, even the smallest, depends on trust. The problem is that, too often, business departments simply do not trust their IT counterparts. Until this problem is tackled and solved, critical initiatives around digital transformation will stall.&#13;

The use of sensors, wearables, analytics, and Machine Learning (ML), as well as advanced manufacturing, Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR), advanced computer numerical control, and robotics have improved products in multiple ways. Industries have moved from rapid prototyping and testing to adding connectivity features to unconnected products along with innovative features. &#13;
&#13;
Organisations are now moving towards monetising the data that they capture via smart products and bundle services in addition to physical assets. Digital signals from consumer interactions with connected assets on the field or from the assets themselves can enable better services and improve warranty claims, visibility into usage patterns, and overall revenue streams. &#13;
&#13;
To utilise these opportunities arising from Industry 4.0, it is necessary to shift from traditional to novel business models. &#13;
&#13;
Smart products present a spectrum of new business model innovations to capture value. For example, there has been a recent shift from traditional ownership models (where customer benefits from the product delivered) to a Product-as-a-Service model (PaaS), where the manufacturer retains ownership and takes full responsibility for the costs of product operation, maintenance, and service in return for a fixed fee. This enables customers to pay as they go. Here, the value from the improvement in product performance, reduction in the overall cost of production, and higher service efficiency are captured by the manufacturer.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Many companies define a “digital twin” as a virtual representation of a process. But for a digital twin to achieve its mission for better optimization, predictive planning, and operational efficiencies, a digital twin must be:&#13;
&#13;
- Truly real-time — with streams of data constantly optimizing and reoptimizing the model.&#13;
&#13;
- AI-enabled, and enabling AI — managed, refined, and optimized by AI models, and used to train AI perception models in autonomous machines or vehicles.&#13;
&#13;
- Physically accurate — full-fidelity 3D representation of the process, system or environment.&#13;
&#13;
- Synchronized to a single physical twin — a digital twin is a twin of only one singular model, and must be in a real-time, constant feedback loop with its one physical twin.&#13;

&#13;
Creating a data culture is one of the keys to building a data-driven organization. The right technology, data literacy, and disrupting the status quo are ways to start.&#13;
&#13;
Data is no longer just a by-product of transactional systems. Applications and technology are now designed around what data is needed for a business to make decisions.&#13;
&#13;
Companies should organize their systems and applications to give the right people access to data so they can make decisions quickly, instead of having data “dumped somewhere and then massaged and arranged for better analytics to make a decision a week or a month or a year later.”&#13;
&#13;
While the right technology is not an easy shortcut to a data culture, technology and culture are two sides of the same coin as both depend on being open to new ways of doing things. Companies with outdated technology — reports and dashboards, on-premises enterprise data warehouses, siloed data marts, and email as the primary source of communication — often have a culture where data is hoarded.&#13;
&#13;
Instead, companies should invest in a modern technology portfolio with AI-driven insights, data lakes, collaboration tools like Slack, cloud-based, logical data warehouses, and augmented analytics. This often correlates to an innovative culture where data is democratized, there is transparency and trust, expertise and insights are shared, and people feel empowered and energized to embrace the new.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
The digitally enabled factory of today looks very different from the leading factory of ten years ago. Advances in data and analytics, AI, and ML—and the array of technology vendors in the market—mean manufacturers can choose from hundreds of potential solutions and tech applications to improve their ways of working.&#13;
&#13;
Implemented successfully, these solutions deliver irresistible returns. Across a wide range of sectors, it is not uncommon to see 30 to 50 percent reductions in machine downtime, 10 to 30 percent increases in throughput, 15 to 30 percent improvements in labour productivity, and 85 percent more accurate forecasting.&#13;
&#13;
Digital transformations are revolutionizing all aspects of manufacturing, touching not just processes and productivity but also people. The right applications of technology can lead to more empowered decision making; new opportunities for upskilling, reskilling, and cross-functional collaboration; better talent attraction and retention; and improved workplace safety and employee satisfaction.&#13;
&#13;
Customers see the impacts through reduced manufacturing lead times, right-first-time launch management, and improved customer service and complexity management. And, of course, there are the win–win advantages associated with reduced environmental impact, made possible through lower emissions and reduced waste and more efficient energy, water, and raw-material consumption.&#13;
&#13;
Whether manufacturers are starting out on their digital-transformation journeys—or recalibrating their approach after false starts or failed attempts—the approaches adopted by leading companies point to seven golden principles for scaling a successful digital transformation:&#13;
1. Communicate well and often&#13;
2. Be specific&#13;
3. Segment, select, and syndicate&#13;
4. Formalize the value at stake&#13;
5. Develop a three- to five-year vision for the network&#13;
6. Design a digital-manufacturing road map&#13;
7. Syndicate the vision and secure leadership buy-in]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jun 2022 07:30:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Post 56</title><link>https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7055974853383757824</link><description>&lt;![CDATA[]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Apr 2023 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Post 55</title><link>https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:share:7150850274943827968</link><description>&lt;![CDATA[🎯 Does your company have a 𝗱𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝘆 in place? &#13;
&#13;
Why not? 💥&#13;
&#13;
While 89% of large companies globally have a digital and AI transformation underway, they have only captured 31% of the expected revenue lift and 25% of the expected cost savings from the effort. &#13;
&#13;
Until business leaders are convinced of the value and confident in how to get it, they are unlikely to do the difficult, hands-in-the-dirt changes needed to improve their success rate. &#13;
&#13;
To see where digital transformation creates value, McKinsey’s did research which tracked the performance of 80 global banks every year from 2018 to 2022 against a set of 50 normalized metrics, such as digital/mobile adoption, digital sales by banking product, number of people in contact centres, and number of branches. &#13;

These solutions have helped them bring in more transparency in their internal systems and savings in their operational costs. However, the next wave of evolution for Industry 4.0 will be to develop solutions that push the boundaries further and help organisations achieve overall optima for their entire value chain. &#13;
&#13;
Driving this new wave of improvements will require a great deal of collaboration between multiple ecosystem partners to come together and develop new integrated solutions. For example, as companies are thinking of reducing the time to market, technologies such BDA would allow integration of disparate algorithms, enabling optimisation across the entire value chain, backed by data. The integrated data would help simulate the impact on key parameters using Digital Twins, empowering organisations to take well-informed decisions at the organisation level. &#13;
&#13;
Organisations will have to look beyond the existing internal alliances for Industry 4.0 needs, which includes collaborating with external partners. The outward look would give rise to newer business models with Industry 4.0 at its centre. For this to happen, there is a need for a stronger digital ecosystem with partnerships at business levels. For example, partnerships between big-data analytics (BDA) service providers, Digital Twin solution providers, and connected solutions. Building one architecture to accommodate these aspects would lead to newer business models, and further, manufacturers enriching the data from their own domains.&#13;
&#13;
It is time for the Industry 4.0 ecosystem to collaborate at the business level and meet the growing needs of manufacturers. For this to happen, organisations need to fund newer business models that enable the digital ecosystem.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
When I speak to clients about their business challenges, they often mention slow processes, untimely data and a lack of functional optimization that leads to potential losses in revenue. While there are multiple ways of solving these problems, the use of “digital twins” is gaining traction.&#13;
&#13;
From an operations perspective, digital twins do three things:&#13;
1. Mirror the exact appearance of the main object&#13;
2. Behave in an identical fashion&#13;
3. Process and analyze information&#13;
&#13;
But the accuracy of models relies on three elements–quality and quantity of data, enabling technologies and business applications such as enterprise resource planning (ERP). Setting the right operations foundations in place is vital for using digital twins to their full advantage and enhancing business performance. Accenture's most recent business operations study showed that organizations that improve their data capabilities, see the biggest impact in improving their operations maturity. 🎯Those with the most advanced level of operations maturity–those that are future-ready–are almost three times as profitable and twice as efficient as their counterparts.🎯&#13;
&#13;
So, how can executives get smarter with data for digital twins?&#13;
&#13;
Data has multiple sources–whether internal or external. Like any other intelligent system, high-quality data is the lifeblood of the twin models of the process flows. Data-led insights can act as a precursor for solving multiple what-if conditions, including the identification of process deviations. Rejections and error detections are also greatly beneficial and when combined, can bring about higher transparency and generate business value. These models are complex and organizations need to use their partners to continually build on existing capabilities.&#13;

Further, organisations can continuously improve their products while significantly reducing the time to launch products.&#13;
&#13;
⚡Some key benefits of BDA and Digital Twins in manufacturing include the following:&#13;
&#13;
𝟭. 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘀𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: BDA and Digital Twins can enable modelling and optimisation of complex processes.&#13;
𝟮. 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲:  an Integrated Big Data platform created for the continuous prediction of machine&#13;
anomalies and failures, leading to reduced downtime in production processes.&#13;
𝟯. 𝗤𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁: Using BDA, the manufacturer analysed the manufacturing process data to identify the &#13;
critical test parameters.&#13;
𝟰. 𝗥𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗹𝗮𝘂𝗻𝗰𝗵 𝗮 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁 𝗼𝗿 𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲: During product development, organisations can virtually experiment using Digital Twins, reducing the time taken to complete trials.&#13;
𝟱. 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁 𝗶𝗻𝗻𝗼𝘃𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: BDA allows organisations to understand their customer base better by gathering &#13;
and analysing customer feedback, product success, and competitor strategies. As a result, organisations can &#13;
introduce new products while simultaneously updating existing ones.&#13;
𝟲. 𝗦𝗮𝗳𝗲𝘁𝘆 𝗲𝗻𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁: Using Digital Twins, organisations can conduct product testing under conditions that involve high temperatures or pressures in a virtual environment, thereby avoiding mishaps. Digital Twins can also help workers navigate the worksite better, especially for large work areas, such as mines or power plants. It also enables safety officers to better visualise potential hazards/conflicts and take pre-emptive action.]]&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2022 07:40:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Post 47</title><link>https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:share:7013783161553707008</link><description>&lt;![CDATA[AI is the key to near-term success in virtually every industry, and top executives know it. 94% of business leaders agree that AI is critical to their organizations’ success over the next five years, and 79% say they have fully deployed three or more AI applications. &#13;
&#13;
But it is one thing to come to a verdict about strategy. It is something else altogether to implement and scale that strategy. Artificial Intelligence brings in new risks that most organizations have never faced before, including concerns about discrimination, unethical use of AI, environmental damage, and the most significant risk of all — permanently falling behind.&#13;
&#13;
Successfully implementing and scaling AI requires cultural change, new job roles and training, and clear commitment from the top.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
With a holistic transformation strategy, AI can create wonders. Do not focus on the technology itself. Start with a business need. If you want to leverage an AI-driven digital transformation so your business becomes more agile, flexible and competitive, it is critical that leaders view digital transformation as a strategic imperative rather than just another trend.&#13;
&#13;
One of the most popular uses of AI is in the areas of customer service and customer experience. Some 52 percent of consumers and 65 percent of business buyers are likely to switch brands if a vendor doesn’t understand their needs and personalise their communications accordingly. Customers also hate to be kept waiting when they’re looking for support. They detest having to type in a lot of information about their issue and being transferred a number of times before reaching the right support representative.&#13;
&#13;
As a catalyst in the digital transformation journey of many organisations, AI is often undervalued. However, there’s no denying that this liberating technology can help businesses become more adaptive, creative, flexible and innovative than ever before. It can not only help businesses win new customers and mitigate risks, but also raise their profits.&#13;
&#13;
A 2017 study by Infosys found that 98 percent of respondents who had leveraged AI for their digital transformation reported that it helped generate additional revenue for their organisations. The same study also revealed that machine learning has had the biggest impact in digital transformation by drastically reducing the average time spent on day-to-day activities and improving decision making while minimising room for errors.&#13;
&#13;
Not just that. In another study by Forrester, 71 percent of respondents reported that AI can improve business efficiency while 59 percent said that it can improve scalability. In addition, 55 percent of respondents said AI can help predict customer behaviour, leading to the development of improved products and services.&#13;

Uncover the underestimated challenge that keeps companies from being data-driven.&#13;
&#13;
Companies have been working to become more data-driven for many years at this point, with mixed results. These efforts play out over time in organizations, and persistence, resilience, execution, and a relentless drive to employ data to make more informed business decisions are what distinguish those companies that prevail from those who continue to struggle.&#13;
&#13;
Right now, the biggest challenge for organizations working on their data strategy might not have to do with technology at all. In the NewVantage Partners annual survey, which tracks the progress of corporate data initiatives, corporate chief data, information, and analytics executives reported that cultural change is the most critical business imperative. &#13;
&#13;
It’s an understandable problem: 𝘁𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗱𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗲𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗽𝗲𝘁𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱, 𝗯𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮-𝗱𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗻 𝗶𝘀 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗼𝗳 𝗽𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗿𝗴𝗮𝗻𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗮𝗱𝗮𝗽𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲. &#13;
&#13;
Long-established companies, which have been successful over generations or centuries, are unlikely to change overnight — the adoption of the internet through digital transformation efforts has played out over the course of the past quarter century. Similarly, the effort by companies to become data-driven represents a business transformation that is playing out over the course of a generation. Much has been achieved, yet more remains to be done.&#13;
&#13;
Becoming a data-driven organization is a journey, which unfolds over time, measured in years, and sometimes decades. &#13;
&#13;
What steps can organizations and business leaders take to accelerate these efforts? ⚡Experience tells us that data-driven organizations consistently demonstrate qualities that distinguish them from their contemporaries. Data-driven companies consistently execute these three driving principles:&#13;
&#13;
1. 𝗧𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗸 𝗱𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁.&#13;
2. 𝗙𝗮𝗶𝗹 𝗳𝗮𝘀𝘁, 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗳𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿.&#13;
3. 𝗙𝗼𝗰𝘂𝘀 𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗹𝗼𝗻𝗴-𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺. &#13;
&#13;
Let's discuss strategies that can catalyze your organization's cultural transformation.&#13;

They contribute more than half the GDP of developed economies and provide between 60% and 70% of employment. And Low-Code/No-Code is set to reshape the way that SMBs use technology.&#13;
&#13;
"While cost and time to market were large factors, the flexibility that a Low-Code/No-Code solution provided was a very important factor... Lo-Code/No-Code development allows us to fail fast in a cost-effective manner and implement those lessons to meet borrowers’ demands."&#13;
&#13;
As we move into a world where the borders between “business” and “IT” are fading fast, there’s a massive opportunity for forward-thinking CIOs to rethink how they work with and lead their organizations. The prize? Accenture research reveals that there are significant rewards available to future-ready organizations that harness digital to operate smarter and faster— achieving breakthrough gains averaging a 🎯2.8x boost in corporate profitability and 🎯1.7x higher efficiency. Low-Code/No-Code is a key element of this. It's not only one of the top routes to higher productivity; it's also one of the ways to get there faster.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Digital transformation can be described as business transformation using digital capabilities. In other words, it’s more than just adopting technology for technology’s sake. There are four common paths to digital transformation. For some companies, it makes sense to choose more than one.&#13;
&#13;
🎯 The researchers found that transformation must happen in two ways: better customer experience and improved operational efficiency. Firms can make progress on one, both, or neither, and they typically take four different pathways to transformation:&#13;
&#13;
1. focus on transforming operations, which commonly means building new business services enabled by application programming interfaces (APIs). &#13;
&#13;
2. focus on an integrated customer experience if metrics such as net promoter score fall well below the industry average&#13;
&#13;
3. take incremental steps in each direction over several iterations, starting with a small step to improve the customer experience (such as a new mobile app) and following that with a small step to streamline operations (such as a new customer relationship management system).&#13;
&#13;
4. starting fresh with a spinoff company — an option if leaders of the current company don’t think it’s possible to change culture, customer experience, and operations fast enough to survive.&#13;
&#13;
Pathways suited to one business unit might not work for another, and sometimes it makes sense to pursue multiple pathways. One part of the business may need an immediate improvement to customer service, while another may have more latitude to take incremental steps.&#13;

&#13;
According to Accenture, data-driven companies are propelled by four key drivers. They:&#13;
&#13;
1) Establish a solid data foundation: Achieved through an agile data supply chain with cloud-based and scalable platforms. &#13;
&#13;
2) Ensure data is secure, relevant and trustworthy: Accomplished through robust data governance, metadata management and data veracity solutions. This is enabled by machine learning (ML) or artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, right people structures and processes. Only a third of firms trusted their data enough to use it effectively and derive value from it.&#13;
&#13;
3) Create an analytics strategy: Attained by focusing on augmenting human efforts with AI and by building capabilities in advanced analytics. Almost 90 per cent of data-driven champions in the survey could attest to being highly involved in data analytics processes and automated approaches as opposed to 54 per cent of others.&#13;
&#13;
4) Envision and launch new data-driven services: Realized through innovative business models and operational efficiency measures. Using a data value scorecard, business outcomes can be measured, tracked and reported effectively.&#13;

Neki problemi su nevidljivi, a neki bodu oči. Identifikovanje problema, kao i njihovih rešenja je nekad lakše uz pomoć ljudi sa strane. Zato je Centar za Digitalnu Transformaciju (CDT) kreirao program podrške kompanijama da digitalizuju svoje poslovanje ali pre toga da uvide gde i kako na najbezbolniji način poboljšati poslovanje kompanije. &#13;

CDT pri Privredna komora Srbije | Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Serbia zatvara uskoro prijavu kompanija na program podrške kompanijama koja žele da se unaprede u digitalnom poslovanju. &#13;
&#13;
Program 2022 se zatvara 31.12.2022. i ostalo je još samo par dana da se kompanije prijave. Program obuhvata stručnu pomoć od strane konsultanata ali i značajnu finansijsku pomoć za implementaciju rešenja. &#13;

Ovo utiče na sve sfere života građana s posebnim naglaskom na ekonomiju. 𝗦𝗸𝗼𝗿𝗼 𝟲% 𝗕𝗗𝗣-𝗮 𝗦𝗿𝗯𝗶𝗷𝗲 𝗰̌𝗶𝗻𝗶 𝗜𝗖𝗧 𝘀𝗲𝗸𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗶 𝘁𝗮𝗷 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝗻𝗮𝘁 𝗿𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲!&#13;
&#13;
Mnoge kompanije iz raznih industrija suočavaju se danas sa još većim izazovima i svaka traži rešenje na svoj način. Podstaknuti pričom o digitalnoj transformaciji, mnogi menadžeri raguju na različine načine:&#13;
&#13;
1. "Šta će to nama? Do sad smo radili ovako i ništa nam ne fali"&#13;
2. "Daj što više tehnologije! Tehnologija će da reši sve naše probleme."&#13;
3. "To mi se čini mnogo skupo... Razmislićemo.."&#13;
4. "Dobro zvuči ta priča ali to nije primenljivo na moju kompaniju ili industriju."&#13;
5. "Jel to može za juče? Hitno nam treba šta god da je...."&#13;
6. nastavite niz&#13;
&#13;
Dobra stvar je što nijedna kompanija nije sama na tom putu. Postoje konsultanti sa iskustvom u vođenju upravo takvih transformacija kompanija koji vode ceo proces strateški i planiranje je na duži period. 𝗝𝗲𝗿, 𝗱𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗻𝗮 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗰𝗶𝗷𝗮 𝗻𝗶𝗷𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗸𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗮 𝘇𝗮𝘃𝗿𝘀̌𝗲𝘁𝗸𝗼𝗺 𝘁𝗼 𝗷𝗲 𝗲𝘃𝗼𝗹𝘂𝗰𝗶𝗷𝗮 𝗸𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗷𝗲. Ovde su bitni ljudi koji čine kompaniju kao i klijenti sa kojima kompanija sarađuje. Tehnologija je samo alat u postizanju ciljeva.&#13;
&#13;
⚡Imajući to u vidu Centar za Digitalnu Transformaciju Privredna komora Srbije | Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Serbia je pokrenuo program digitalne transformacije kompanija uz 𝗽𝗼𝗺𝗼𝗰́ 𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘁𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗸𝗼𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗵 𝗸𝗼𝗻𝘀𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗶 𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗷𝘀𝗸𝘂 𝗽𝗼𝗱𝗿𝘀̌𝗸𝘂 od strane države.&#13;
